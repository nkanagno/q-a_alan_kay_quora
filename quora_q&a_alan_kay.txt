Interview's Question: Computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra said that “It is far more likely that the programming occupation will become extinct than that programmers will ever approach professional status.” What did Dijkstra mean by that and do you agree with Dijkstra?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ll start by saying that I don’t clearly understand the English as simply stated.

However, three things might help us (a) English was not Edsger’s native language (b) he was very proud of his skills in English (c) he delighted in coming up with snide remarks (one of his good friends was Bob Barton, who also liked to do this).

I read this as “programmers will never approach professional status” — and — “the programming occupation will never become extinct (too bad)”!

He desired the process of getting computers to “do what we mean!” to be rather like the mathematics he was used to when getting his PhD in mathematical physics. In his own words:

After having programmed for some three years, I had a discussion with A. van Wijngaarden, who was then my boss at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam, a discussion for which I shall remain grateful to him as long as I live. The point was that I was supposed to study theoretical physics at the University of Leiden simultaneously, and as I found the two activities harder and harder to combine, I had to make up my mind, either to stop programming and become a real, respectable theoretical physicist, or to carry my study of physics to a formal completion only, with a minimum of effort, and to become....., yes what? A programmer? But was that a respectable profession? For after all, what was programming? Where was the sound body of knowledge that could support it as an intellectually respectable discipline? I remember quite vividly how I envied my hardware colleagues, who, when asked about their professional competence, could at least point out that they knew everything about vacuum tubes, amplifiers and the rest, whereas I felt that, when faced with that question, I would stand empty-handed.

He had “bitten the apple” and gotten hooked. And the dual attractions and repulsions of math on the one side and programming on the other stayed with him his whole life.

It was his pristineness towards the former that got him to disparage the latter — even though that was the path he also had taken …


Interview's Question: Was one byte ever less than eight bits in the past?
Alan's kay Answer: When I started “programming as a job” in the US Air Force (ca 1962), the most general meaning for a “byte” was “a contiguous field of bits in a word that was smaller in size than the word”.

I still remember feeling annoyed when IBM redefined the term to mean an 8-bit entity (I remember this from 1964 when System 360 was announced — however, IBM could have forced the redefinition before this).

The Wikipedia article is rather wishy-washy about this. I think that my definition in the first paragraph is actually correct. 


Interview's Question: Is programming learned inductively or deductively?
Alan's kay Answer:  "I don’t feel I completely understand this question (or perhaps don't understand the intention behind the question). But we can certainly start by comparing various kinds of reasoning already addressed in Quora: What's the difference between “inductive“ “deductive“ and “abductive“ reasoning? Let me add an additional one or two: “projective reasoning” — this is similar to “abductive reasoning”. It is familiar in both mathematics and programming as a kind of “feeling” about a situation (in programming it often occurs as a “sense of difficulty or ease” when a problem is mentioned). It is also likely related to what is called “forward reasoning”: to take definitions/premises and drive them “forward” using logical operations to reach conclusions (so: similar to deduction but driving “outwards”). My first paying job as a programmer/coder was in 1962 — so 63 years ago as of this writing — as an enlisted man in the US Air Force. They had a test to screen for possible aptitudes. Those who passed were trained by IBM in a single dense wall to wall week and then sent back to base to write and debug code (i.e. the rest of the training was “on the job training”). From my own personal experience I would say the answer to this question is “All of the above (including my additions) and more”. One example of “more” is that it was common enough back then for the hardware to have glitches — sometimes “intermittant glitches” — so that one could not completely rely that executions were completely deterministic. I think I might instead say that “Learning programming is both learning how to “solve problems” and especially how to “find problems” mixed in with much more “design” than one appreciates at first.”"


Interview's Question: What are your thoughts on a future where code is represented as a structured model, rather than text? Do you think that AI-powered coding assistants benefit from that?
Alan's kay Answer: First, it’s worth noting that the “syntax recognition” phase of most compilers already does build a “structured model”, often in what used to be called a “canonical form” (an example of this might be a “pseudo-function tree” where every elementary process


Interview's Question: Why did Japan’s Fifth Generation Computer Systems project fail commercially? Are any of its concepts and advances presently being utilized?

Interview's Question: How does Alan Kay describe the nature of his way of collaboration? Would he be willing to work with teams that are below average, which could diminish the quality of his work and lower his motivation?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t know the answer to this (I’ve always tried to work with colleagues who are more able than I am — going back to playing in bands, theatre, tennis, science, etc.). Also, ARPA-IPTO had the interesting idea of creating groups of smart people where no-


Interview's Question: Since von Neumann invented the merge sort algo in 1945, just before ENIAC was introduced in 1946, what does Alan Kay think motivated him to explore sorting algos when computers were still so new and HLL didn't yet exist?
Alan's kay Answer: Richard Norman has already provided a nice short accurate answer to this question.

The notion of “algorithm” goes back at least to the early Greeks (and several are given by Euclid).

Interview's Question: "Great visions are not goals, but the ultimate cat toy". What does this idea mean to Alan Kay? And could it relate to your belief that ‘you don’t truly understand something if you only understand it one way’?"
Alan's kay Answer: I’m trying to understand this question. I used the quoted phrase above in several talks (many are on YouTube), to explain how JCR Licklider in the 60s, was able to get so many highly talented researchers to work on interactive computing and world-wide net


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay suggest here: "Computing is not about clocks, it's about biology". How come the essence of computing is more about the way living organisms evolve?
Alan's kay Answer: I wouldn’t have said the “quoted phrase” in the way it is stated (so the quotes likely mean something else). And I wouldn’t have said “The essence of computing is more about the way living things evolve” (I would have used a term like “work”, instead of “


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think about ADHD in adults? Should it be controlled with medication?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t have the medical background to answer generally. However, I have many creative close friends who have ADHD. Most of them use the drugs to help (they do help greatly) to cope with many actions in the world that are difficult for those with ADHD. Wh

Interview's Question: Why didn't Doug Engelbart's chording keyset become a standard interface like the mouse did? It requires more training, but would have a dramatic impact on user performance.
Alan's kay Answer: Here’s the classic Engelbart NLS interface: This was the result of testing many alternative designs. A basic principle was that the hands should be “out” for navigation and “small text” (so “out” required all text to be able to be entered with the five fi


Interview's Question: How valuable is it to apply concepts like the Curry-Howard correspondence (proofs as programs) and inductive proofs to the development of dynamic/complex systems, considering their correlation with type systems?
Alan's kay Answer: One of Marvin Minsky’s many thought provoking sayings was “The trouble with ‘New Math’ is that you have to understand it every time you use it!”. (Meaning, there is an important pragmatic place for mentally caching “rules that work” rather than working th


Interview's Question: What is the importance of Christopher Alexander’s work for system/software designers?
Alan's kay Answer: I think the most useful of the Alexander books is the first one “Notes on a Synthesis of Form”. It was his PhD thesis at Harvard, and has thought provoking discussions of *systems* and *design*. I don’t think his books are useful as direct guides to how t


Interview's Question: What is the difference between soft computing and nano computing?
Alan's kay Answer: I had to look up both of these terms (neither was in use back when I was most active). You could look them up yourself, but as long as I’m already writing … (a) “soft computing” is defined as “employing the kinds of thinking methods used by humans and oth


Interview's Question: How much RAM did computers typically have when you first started using them?
Alan's kay Answer: I realize that I didn’t completely answer this question. I’ve now split it into 2 parts: [1] my personal experience in 1962, and [2] the more general state of things in the US at that time. [1] The first real computer that I programmed as a job was the IB


Interview's Question: What happened to the "parc copies" created by Xerox at PARC? Have they been preserved or recycled?
Alan's kay Answer: I wrote an answer to an equivalent question: Was anything meaningful lost for good when Xerox threw out their old PARC data disks?


Interview's Question: What is the origin of the name "The Internet"? Was it chosen as a play on words with "interconnected networks"? Were there any other names considered before "The Internet" was chosen?
Alan's kay Answer: JCR Licklider — an experimental psychologist and (ca 1959/60s) fan of interactive computing — was given a lot of money by the DoD to set up a long range computer research community. One of his first memos looked like this: There is a good story (I’ve told


Interview's Question: How would Alan Kay go about designing a systems design course? What contents should be covered, and what knowledge or skills should one gain? Which exemplary projects/papers should be included to facilitate understanding?
Alan's kay Answer: In the true fashion of the 1960s-thru-1970s ARPA-IPTO research community (which included Parc), I would try to find the best people who could do this, and help find funds to support them.

I would try to help form a joint vision large and comprehensive en


Interview's Question: What is Alan Kay's perspective on the obsession with learning memory management and other "low-level" aspects when it comes to programming education?

Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think of Ted Nelsons criticism of Xerox PARC? (Taking away the "right to program" by hiding everything behind the "PUI" and making computers into paper simulators with single-collumn text)
Alan's kay Answer: Ted has done a lot for personal computing, but occasionally gets things wrong. I got invited to give a talk for his 70th or 75th birthday, and decided to use a 1978 Xerox Parc Smalltalk system to show what we really did, and to praise him at the same time


Interview's Question: What do you think is the future of software engineering? Could advancements in technology eventually render it obsolete, or will these advancements serve as valuable tools that enhance the work of software engineers rather than replacing them?
Alan's kay Answer: Here’s part of a slide I used in a talk in 2021 expressing a kind of “Hippocratic Oath” within Engineering: The first two have been around for thousands of years. The ones for airplanes and software more recently. It’s worth noting that in every era there

Interview's Question: Has Alan Kay started any activist movements to realize his vision of personal computing? What were the hurdles? The negative impact of capitalism and corporations, etc. What one can do as a political act?
Alan's kay Answer: This is not my nature.

But Doug Engelbart had some feel for this — and still, wound up not getting through to the larger organizations of society.

I think part of the problem is that in our current day (and probably most past days), any real inventions 


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think about collaboration as it applies to Xerox PARC? What about the structure of PARC, and the people who were there contributed to such amazing collaborations and outcomes?
Alan's kay Answer: There are parts of the answer to this question in some of my other answers about Xerox Parc. (I would put in links here if Quora were easier to search — maybe some readers will help.)

The best book I’ve read about this research community is “The Dream Ma


Interview's Question: How does Alan Kay view the connection between the relational model and "real OOP"? How would you avoid “impadence mismatch” problem with RDBMS? How was with Smalltalk Systems?
Alan's kay Answer: This deserves a longer answer than this.

One interesting history is that of “unit records”, eventually being kept as a deck of “Hollerith” and then “IBM” cards. The deck would most usually use one card for each record, and would use the same fields — a s

Alan's kay Answer: My wife and I were renting a flat in London — where she was working on a book. I woke up in the middle of the night — for “old men’s reasons” — and decided to see how much Hilary Clinton had won by. I don’t think I’ve ever been more surprised upon waking 


Interview's Question: What is Alan Kay's advice for smart people who don't yet know what they're interested in working on? How deep should people explore topics like maths and science before deciding it isn't for them?
Alan's kay Answer: The advice given by “The Valark” below is pretty good. Part of the idea is that for the most part each person is interesting and idiosyncratic enough to need “custom advice”, which is often best obtained through many experiences of their own. Einstein sai


Interview's Question: Did pipe organs develop at all during the classical period?
Alan's kay Answer: “Classical period” in history (e.g. the ancient Greeks) or “classical period” in music (e.g. Haydn, Mozart, etc.)? The answer of Alan Piersonn to “Did the Greeks create the first pipe organ?” gives the bare facts for the ancient Greeks. If the question me


Interview's Question: If Alan Kay could travel in time, back to the inception of computing, but could only take a notebook as a knowledge base from today, which insights would he pick/ignore, how would he approach recreating computing, and which year would he choose?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t know how to answer this question directly. But let’s consider Doug Engelbart, who in effect, did something very much like this. In 1962 he wrote an extensive research proposal (for funding from the Air Force) with the title: Using the phrasing of 


Interview's Question: How can I get in contact with Alan Kay for an interview for my high school project? I want to interview him about the history behind the development of the GUI and his work at PARC
Alan's kay Answer: Please tell me more about your high school project …

In any case, a good place to start is to read enough of what is available to gather enough context to ask good questions and to see how the answers fit with history.

Here’s a relatively short tribute 


Interview's Question: If Alan Kay were starting a computing research group today, how would he think about where to locate it?
Alan's kay Answer: Interesting query. I have only had extensive experience with one style of “research grouping” — the ARPA/Parc style was very successful — but it is quite possible that there are other styles that would also work very well.

Interview's Question: If earning a lot of money is my target, what major should I choose? My interest was in computer science, but people are saying to me that don't do it because AI is going to replace it. What should I do?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t think I can give you a satisfactory answer for a number of reasons. The first and largest one is that I’ve never had making money as a target.

I have always thought that “making money” is much too small a goal for human beings. At best, it could 


Interview's Question: How does Alan Kay view the use of artificial intelligence to guide diagnosis and treatment in clinical medicine? I've been invited to write a "Con" review re: AI in hypertension (someone else to provide "Pro") & I wish to learn Alan Kay's thoughts.
Alan's kay Answer: *Actual* “artificial intelligence” could be of great use. This term today has been watered down to mean something quite different than when it was coined more than 60 years ago.

The central issue here is how to vet the processes from phenomena to causal 


Interview's Question: Was there ever a serious attempt to a "multiple inheritance" Smalltalk cc: Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls? If there was, why didn't it work out?
Alan's kay Answer: Bob Taylor — who set up Parc computing research — was one of the directors of ARPA-IPTO (and, when there, among many of his good deeds were to heavily support Doug Engelbart, Dave Evans, and to get the ARPAnet started). As I’ve written elsewhere, IPTO had


Interview's Question: Now that machines can generate and "understand" language, what would Alan Kay argue that are a set of first principles from which to rethink the human-machine interface?
Alan's kay Answer: One of the ways to spot many LLMs is to note that they often don’t handle “gender anaphora” well (meaning that a sentence about a man will be followed by a sentence also about that subject but using “she” instead of “he”). This is really ugly and bad (esp

Interview's Question: What was the first PC, Kenbak that's according to AC M and Steve Wozniac or LINK, according to Alan C. Kay?
Alan's kay Answer: First, we have to decide on the term “personal computer”. I have defined it as something one can easily have in their house, made in some quantity, that has at least textual I/O, and real programs can be written on it. A really early one would be the Bend


Interview's Question: How can anyone take math and physics seriously enough to devote a career to them, (overwhelming evidence that the material universe obeys mathematics) without positing that abstract entities have an independent existence outside the human mind?
Alan's kay Answer: Many of the answers to related questions are worth reading and pondering. For example, see what James Fullwood has to say. Here is what Einstein had to say early in a talk to physicists in a lecture at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1921. First, he n


Interview's Question: What question(s) might Alan Kay like to answer that he has not yet been asked (publicly)?
Alan's kay Answer: Thanks for asking, but if it worked that way, I would be continuously writing essays, etc.

Interview's Question: When was the first computer invented? Who invented the Internet?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ve answered the first question a few times on Quora. By just saying “computer”, we can look far back in the past to find mechanisms invented by humans to help them reason and calculate. Two very old ones (B.C.) are the abacus — not just in China, but in


Interview's Question: Isn't artificial intelligence just a fancy name for sophisticated programming running in fast enough computers?
Alan's kay Answer: This is a pretty good question — especially because you are trying to separate labels from actual meanings.

I think homing in on a good definition of “intelligence” will help you answer your question for yourself — especially if you can come up with a go


Interview's Question: What was the best computer system you worked on (or with) and why? For "best" and "computer system" pick your own definitions. 🙂
Alan's kay Answer: Thank you Mark!

For me, questions like this are in the same category as “What is the best book you have read?”, “What is the best food you have eaten?”, “What is the best musical instrument (or even “best guitar” or “best pipe organ”) you have played?”, 


Interview's Question: Which personal computer was the first to use an operating system not based on Unix?
Alan's kay Answer: As I define “Personal Computer” Wes Clarke’s LINC from the early 60s qualifies as one of the first (see “The LINC Was Early And Small” by Wes in ACM’s “History of Personal Workstations”).

It had a display, a keyboard, virtual memory, etc. — and an intera


Interview's Question: What are some good biographies that every aspiring programmer should read?
Alan's kay Answer: Sadly, as with histories of our field/profession, most are not very good.

One I liked a lot — and I knew the author over many years as well — was “Computing in the Middle Ages” by Severo Ornstein, who was one of the main people on the LINC (the first per


Interview's Question: Discuss fully the history of computer and the operating systems. Why are Gul-based operating systems more popular than command line interface (CLI) based operating system?
Alan's kay Answer: This sounds like a combination of a command and a homework assignment (a would be command). Please try me again with the first sentence omitted.


Interview's Question: What profound insights did Seymour Cray have that allowed him to design faster computers than others could at the time? Do they consist of proper cooling and signal sync, which, frankly, seem to be methods that computer scientists should have known?
Alan's kay Answer: I had both the privilege and experience of working with Seymour Cray in 1965 on his CDC 6600 at his Chippewa Falls lab (when he was still with Control Data). I very strongly suggest that you first read the Wikipedia article on Seymour Cray to get a small 


Interview's Question: Where do you think programs begin to be a "big ball of mud"? That is where do you think programs get large enough that a person cannot track all the interactions between the parts, even if the parts are coherent abstractions?
Alan's kay Answer: The great computer scientist — and first Turing Award winner — Alan Perlis, liked to say “One person’s constant is another person’s variable”.

For concepts, cognitive science has measured “cognitive load” going back to George Miller’s 7±2 simultaneous “c


Interview's Question: How might Alan Kay elaborate on "You could think of it [Val Shorre's Meta II] as an active interface language on objects"?
Alan's kay Answer: Part of the context here is from the early thinking about objects (using Meta II as an example of a pattern matcher), and part is very relevant to today and its scalings.

Let’s suppose we’ve gotten far enough to see that “entities” that can act as whole 


Interview's Question: Is it necessary to make a GUI version for a simple program?
Alan's kay Answer: In the spirit of “Context is worth 80 IQ points”, let’s try a different perspective. A UI is the meeting ground between processes, especially between humans and media (where the “process” is sometimes the description of another “process”). To me, then, th


Interview's Question: Is the most important thing for programming "readable code"? If you had to name only one thing.
Alan's kay Answer: I wouldn’t name just one thing: this is a bit like asking “which leg of a three legged stool is the most important one?”

For example — in the end — (b) we are always creating systems and integrating with systems. So it is really “an important thing” that

Alan's kay Answer: The answer by Jim Lux will help. Here’s another slant on this. A lot of early computer programming was about taking mathematical formulas and writing code to compute them. One of the very first “higher level programming languages” (released in 1956) was F


Interview's Question: What programming language does Alan Kay consider to be the most advanced?
Alan's kay Answer: I used to track programming languages as well as I could (but as Jean Sammet pointed out in the late 60s, “There already have been over 3000 PLs designed and made. How can we sort them?”).

The ACM chooses languages for its “History of Programming Languag


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think about programming and teaching programming with copilots and LLMs of today?
Alan's kay Answer: A little context and bias before I attempt to give an answer: I started programming as a job ca 1961 in the USAF. The programming style was “data munged by imperatives with loops” (sound familiar?). An interesting wrinkle was that the machines we used at 


Interview's Question: What is machine code? Is it really the lowest level of programming? If it is, how does this make sense as we still have assembly languages and high-level languages like C++ and Java?
Alan's kay Answer: This is a pretty good question. This answer is a bit more detailed than the others (but read the others, they have useful information). In “the olden days” of the early 60s when I was a journeyman programmer, we would often call the lowest level in which 


Interview's Question: How did the first computers look like and what could they do, compared to modern-day machines?
Alan's kay Answer: The question explicitly says “first computers” — so, for anyone with a taste for history, this should rule out answers for computers that happened after 1955 or so, and I will concentrate on “first programmable computers”. One nice part of the answer is t


Interview's Question: Does Alan Kay have any updated thoughts on "People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware"?
Alan's kay Answer: In brief: I’ve pointed out — long ago now — that “hardware is just software crystallized early”. If we combine this with why we want computers that can take on and run software (so we don’t have to go to the trouble of making special hardware for each fun


Interview's Question: What were the main ideas that eventually led to the design of modeless human computer interaction and modeless interfaces?
Alan's kay Answer: The other answers are pretty good, and I’ve already answered this in Quora somewhere else (see if you can find it), but just to be brief here.

The most important idea was that “modes are useful, until you want to do something else”. For example, *inserti


Interview's Question: Why does Alan Kay call his youth misspent?
Alan's kay Answer: That was a joke about how many things I did that *weren’t* computing.

Actually, pretty much everything I got fluent at as a “youth” wound up contributing to my later thinking and results as a computerist. For example, I got degrees in both pure math and 


Interview's Question: When Alan Kay conceived of object-oriented programming as being about objects that hide their state and send messages to other objects, how large were these objects imagined to be, and how closely does current teaching and programming reflect this?
Alan's kay Answer: Summary: they were always thought of as “all sizes” — this is what messaging allows one to think — but it took awhile to invent all the software engineering needed to make the nice idea practical enough for real system building.

Though I had been a journ


Interview's Question: Why did Alan Kay move to London?
Alan's kay Answer: Short answer is that my wife — the amazing Bonnie MacBird — decided she wanted to write a Sherlock Holmes novel in the authentic voice of Doyle’s Watson. She had been a super fan since childhood, and this project had been on the back burner for years. As 


Interview's Question: Why did you major in mathematics?
Alan's kay Answer: I always was interested in math, and especially after reading in a Robert Heinlein scifi book for youngsters that “No matter how or where you wind up you should understand mathematics”

I never had a plan to *be* a mathematician (I think), and the other o


Interview's Question: Since Smalltalk programming language has roots in biology, is it a perfect match for various computational biology applications(like system biology, agent-based modeling)? If so, what are some good examples of existing applications?
Alan's kay Answer: Smalltalk does have some of its roots in biology — but certainly when I was thinking about this kind of language in the mid to late 60s, I was not using much — if anything — of what I understood about molecular biology (a really early book on Mol-Bio was 


Interview's Question: Alan, you have written numerous essays and given many talks on the topic of computing, but you have never published a book on the subject. Is there any particular reason behind this decision? Is it related to your idea of the Dynabook?
Alan's kay Answer: Probably the simplest answer to the question is that I like to work on things I have “urges” to do, and I’ve never had the “urge” to write a book.

On the other hand, I do have an urge to answer questions, and Quora reveals that I’ve written 607 answers t


Interview's Question: Does Alan Kay see the educational goals behind the Dynabook concept furthered by AI systems, especially in light of developments like GPT-4? Can this improve computer interaction and computer aided learning?
Alan's kay Answer: One of the earliest stated goals — in the late 60s — for real education for children, perhaps helped along with a “Dynabook”, was: to have children grow up to think better than most adults do today.

Most of the time we thought of this as part of a vastly


Interview's Question: What is the specific reference for Alan Kay's discussion related to people in business not wanting to hear complaints and why they should welcome them?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t recall saying this.


Interview's Question: What is the meaning of Alan Kay's quote "the best way to predict the future is to invent it"? How can this be applied to any field of work?
Alan's kay Answer: This came out in a fit of frustration during a meeting in the early days of Parc with the Xerox corporate planning group.

I wasn’t trying to coin an aphorism, but this accidentally happened.

I happen to really like aphorisms — I think of them as a “spec


Interview's Question: What does it mean to be an "Alan Kay" programmer? What are some ways to become more creative in programming?
Alan's kay Answer: An “Alan Kay programmer” is a person with a few odd, potentially worthwhile, ideas, and deep enough knowledge and skills to work with a group of people with much deeper skills.

For example, this question would never have been asked if I hadn’t started wo


Interview's Question: Do you agree with Alan Kay's comment that a computer science degree teaches students how to write bad code?
Alan's kay Answer: I never said that — we should at least pose an accurate question.

One of the (many) things I have pointed out is that a computer science degree is no guarantee of “the kind of perspectives that are needed for (good) computing” — this has parallels with t


Interview's Question: How did Alan Kay recruit and interview his researchers at VPRI?
Alan's kay Answer: I just noticed that I have been misreading this question — or it got changed? In any case, my answer below was about my ARPA and Parc experiences. I’ve added a little bit about Viewpoints Research Institute (which I didn’t set up until the early 2000s), a


Interview's Question: Can I become competent programmer if I will start learning Computer Science without attending university lessons, only relying on textbooks, internet resources?
Alan's kay Answer: I feel that this is an honestly asked question — and it is a difficult one, in part because it isn’t complete (it lacks many side conditions, such as how you are going to get experience writing programs, and especially how you are going to get feedback to


Interview's Question: I used chatGPT to summarise some of your opinions. What does the real living human think of artificial intelligence condensation of these previously expressed opinions?
Alan's kay Answer: Here are two chatGPT summaries, as furnished by Mark Dickson:

Criticism on computer science: Write a criticism of the lack of progress in computer science and software engineering as Alan Curtis Kay would write it.

Interview's Question: What was the source of documentation and programming knowledge before the internet? How did daily coding look like without having access to Google?
Alan's kay Answer: The major HW manufacturers had “SHARE” organizations of their customers to share lore and sometimes code. In the research game, there were papers from the several main conferences and the ACM, etc., that imparted techniques (these were invaluable). For do


Interview's Question: Are the slides (Squeak image) available for the Alan Kay talk linked in comment?
Alan's kay Answer: They aren’t right now, but — without promising anything — something like them might be made available in 2023 or 2024. Here’s the talk in question: (starts at 2:15 if the link doesn’t do it). Smalltalk had unlimited “projects”, which can be thought of as 


Interview's Question: What is the history of the first personal computer?
Alan's kay Answer: I think we first have to come up with an agreed on definition for “personal computer”. What most people think of is something which cost originally in the range of a television set — but I think we could extend that to include other “personally owned thin


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think of Ruby programming language, since it was inspired by Smalltalk?
Alan's kay Answer: As I said to a similar question about Swift: I don’t think my opinion matters.

However, I think the Ruby people did a number of nice things with their design. I think that more kinds of *safe reflection* and *workable MOP*, etc., would enhance the good t


Interview's Question: How an object is created? What are the important parts necessary to create an object?
Alan's kay Answer: This is an interesting question — I’ll take it to include “… on a vanilla computer with no “object language” already present”.

My view back in the 60s: since any computer with enough memory can simulate any other (including future computers), then a simu


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think of Neil Postman's invited talk at Apple in 1993, and are his main arguments even more pertinent & relevant now 30 years later?
Alan's kay Answer: I think the referred to talk was:

(there is some noise on the left audio channel — balance to the right to help.)

Neil and I were good friends. I set up this talk and invited him to have a go at a room full of rather set opinions.

He once told me a sto


Interview's Question: Do you think that Alan Kay was more focused on children than education? Why?
Alan's kay Answer: H.G. Wells said it better than I can: “Civilization is in a race between education and catastrophe”. His notion that education could be a deterrent to catastrophe was part of the age old “nature vs. nurture” questions that gained ground as Anthropology an


Interview's Question: What did Kay mean by “I wanted to get rid of data. The B5000 almost did this via its almost unbelievable HW architecture.”?
Alan's kay Answer: One way to think about classical “data” is that it is something passive that can be munged by an assignment operation. Procedural languages generally have variables and data structures that can be munged — so-called “OOP” languages generally permit “sette


Interview's Question: Why is school & college the way it is, limiting most children's potential?
Alan's kay Answer: This is why good questions are very often better than answers—especially when it is about systemic problems.

Sometimes, when in this position, just working on “how things should be” will get further than trying to figure exactly how things got to be so b


Interview's Question: What is the major obstacle in teaching computing in general and coding in particular in primary and secondary schools?
Alan's kay Answer: This is a good question that can lead to even better questions.

First, I think the problems with most of education — including about computing — are systemic, with many parts failed or missing. In addition, the current failed system is large and active a


Interview's Question: What was the staff size at Parc?
Alan's kay Answer: Parc had 4 labs: computer science, systems, physics, optical. The ARPA culture that formed most of the computer part of Parc pervaded most of the first two, and none of the others. My group and I were in the Systems Lab and both Systems and Computer Scien


Interview's Question: Could Xerox PARC have been done remotely with today's technology (not necessarily methods)? What does Alan Kay think about "remote work" for collaborative research?
Alan's kay Answer: This is an interesting — and tricky — question. For one thing, attempts to create “a Xerox Parc” in any form have not been successful. I think the previous ARPA community was critical to helping shape most of the researchers who formed Parc, and that many


Interview's Question: What are some notable reimplementations of SketchPad by Sutherland?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t know of any reimplimentations — but I wish there were.

Alan Borning’s “ThingLab” thesis at Stanford/Parc improved on a few of the Sketchpad ideas, but did not cover the whole territory. He is also responsible for numerous constraint solver system


Interview's Question: How did Alan Kay decide to take inspiration from a biological system - (operations of a biological cell) to an (human) engineering system namely object oriented programming…was it just random inspiration or was he intentional about it?
Alan's kay Answer: The actual history of the particular set of inspirations is given in “The Early History Of Smalltalk” written for the ACM “History of Programming Languages II in the early 90s.

Many of these kinds of decisions depend on how loosely or strictly one sees a


Interview's Question: What can you say that everything you see in nature is governed by the patterns based on mathematical concepts and theories? What is it about mathematics that might have changed your thoughts about it?
Alan's kay Answer: IMO, this question seems backwards — it is far more likely that nature is just the way it is, and we are the “pattern assigners” to the phenomena we can detect. I say “IMO” because the overall question is more philosophical than scientific (which IMO is a


Interview's Question: How did Xerox PARC invent the mouse?
Alan's kay Answer: Xerox Parc didn’t invent the mouse. The original mouse was invented by Doug Engelbart and Bill English in 1964 as part of investigations into how to use pointing and gestures as input to interactive computing system. This uses an old idea — that dragging 


Interview's Question: What became of the work done at VPRI?
Alan's kay Answer: The website for papers still exists:

Viewpoints Research Institute
After 16 years of continuous research and important contributions toward its mission - "Improve 'powerful ideas education' for the world's children and to advance the state of systems res


Interview's Question: What was the oldest computer or device you remember using? How does this compare to the machines you use today?
Alan's kay Answer: The first programs I wrote that ran on a computer were done ca 1962 in the Air Force for an IBM 1401 with 8k 6 bit characters.

However, while in grad school a little later I got to write a few programs for the Lincoln Labs TX-2, some of whose HW dated to


Interview's Question: If Alan Kay was doing a PhD thesis today, would he write all software from scratch? Is that more than what is actually needed to get the point across?
Alan's kay Answer: Originally Answered: If Alan Kay was doing a PhD thesis today, would he write all software from scratch? Is that more than What Is Actually Needed to get the point across?
Ivan Sutherland once pointed out that “A thesis is something 3 people will sign”, a


Interview's Question: How does Alan Kay think Ivan Illich performed as a problem-finder?
Alan's kay Answer: I think anyone interested in education past, present, and especially future should read Illich’s books — particularly “Deschooling Society” — for an early deep critique of standard schooling — and “Convivial Tools” for crucial perspectives on our tool-bas


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think of James Kunstler’s “The Geography of Nowhere”?
Alan's kay Answer: Summary: worth reading overall, could be more aimed at *why* people/society are the way they are rather than just the nutty, even crazy things people have done and are doing without the notion of consequences.

This book is on Kindle (for $0) and I encour


Interview's Question: Why did so many of the innovations at Xerox PARC not make it into mainstream computing until several decades later? What lessons can future innovators learn from this?
Alan's kay Answer: It’s worth looking at the history of the Ethernet. It was of interest to the outside world because there wasn’t a workable solution to “local area nets” in the 70s, and the Ethernet worked nicely (if a bit oddly to conventional thinking). Still, it had a 


Interview's Question: Why was Charles Babbage unsuccessful in creating a working mechanical computer, when the Jacquard loom had already been invented?
Alan's kay Answer: It’s interesting to compare the recreation of “the difference engine” with the Jacquard loom. The approach to engineering and practicality could hardly be more different. The difference engine was much simpler than the analytical engine, but could barely 


Interview's Question: Hi Alan, I am a huge fan of yours. I'm just a regular computer/phone user who is trying to get a job in the industry, but I want to help advance computing in the ways you described. What can I do? I'm interested in utilizing today's powerful hardware
Alan's kay Answer: I suggest looking at the idea of “What Is Actually Needed” (WIAN), which I’ve written about in Quora, and occasionally described in talks. The center of the idea is that just trying to improve something often doesn’t take enough context into account, and 


Interview's Question: What is the list of civilization's most "powerful ideas"?
Alan's kay Answer: I think the top of the list is

There are powerful ideas
From here on, they come in many shapes and sizes. For example, one of the biggest is

2. Human brains are not great for thinking, but can be taught how to think much better

This is part of the fact


Interview's Question: Where does Alan Kay draw the line between tinkering and inverse vandalism?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t think it matters where I draw the line, but having a real sense of “inverse vandalism” (making things just because you can) can be very important in an age where the industrial revolution can not just make in quantity, but can oversupply.

One key


Interview's Question: What is considered an early version of a graphical user interface (GUI)?
Alan's kay Answer: There were a number of excellent GUIs before Parc (most of which provided ideas we used at Parc). My favorites were Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad system (ca 1962–3) and the RAND Corp’s GRAIL (GRAphical Input Language) system). This research at RAND was part


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think independent researchers in computing should do for money if commercialization was part of the problem? What if "good funding" for research isn't available, but your ideas are worth pursuing?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t know. There is no lack of money, especially when one looks at what the computer part of Xerox Parc cost, or even what the ARPA-IPTO community cost.

In my own experience, I and the other researchers within ARPA/ONR/Parc, etc knew we were in a wond


Interview's Question: Why wasn't the GUI by Xerox PARC or Xerox Star developed earlier? There was Sketchpad in 1963, which was a predecessor of a GUI, 20 years before.
Alan's kay Answer: The other answers are pretty good.

Let me first point out that the Alto at Parc with its bitmap display and overlapping window interface was done in 1973, which was only 10 years after Sketchpad, and for practical reasons required the first integrated ci


Interview's Question: How could Xerox come up with advanced innovation tech (i.e. GUI) since their managements or leaders know nothing?
Alan's kay Answer: First, *some* of their management *did know things*. For example, the new Chief Scientist they got from Ford — Jack Goldman — was a first class physicist who also had a good feeling for what large companies needed. He urged Xerox to set up a Long Range Re


Interview's Question: In the movie “Hidden Figures” is the depiction of the delivery of an IBM computer. Did the components actually not fit into the computer room as depicted in the movie, or is that “artistic licence”?
Alan's kay Answer: My original answer (that the movie scene was “unlikely”) starts with the third paragraph. I then got interested in the movie and liked the characters and the acting, but didn’t think the writing and directing did justice to the historical characters or th


Interview's Question: What is the significance of Butler Lampson's work?
Alan's kay Answer: A good reply is much too large for a Quora sized reply.

Basically: Butler is one of the most significant computer scientists in history — and has been one since he moved from physics to computing almost 60 years ago. He was always a “principal scientist,


Interview's Question: How does a computer know what to do with binary code 01000001? How does the computer know this means A who told the computer?
Alan's kay Answer: To get started thinking about this, it would be a good idea to not use the word “know”. A better really simple analogy is how keys and locks work, where the lock is set up physically to accept or resist the carved patterns on keys. We generally would not 


Interview's Question: How does a computer work? Explain with an example.
Alan's kay Answer: Originally Answered: How do I explain how a computer works in my own words?
In the answer to the parent question, Jay Nabonne gives an excellent suggestion: to find ways to understand computers, then try to explain them yourself to others (which will gene


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think about the harmony-oriented programming paradigm (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1449814.1449872)?
Alan's kay Answer: Originally Answered: What does Alan Kay think about the harmony-oriented programming paradigm (https://dl.acm.org/ DOI/10.1145/1449814.1449872)?
This URL results in a 404 error (the correct URL is in a comment). This is a very short speculative paper. In 


Interview's Question: What are some tips for a 16-year-old that wants to be a professor in computer science, specifically in type theory and programming language theory?
Alan's kay Answer: I think the best way to be a professor in a subject is to first become a first class practitioner in the subject, and gradually learn how to explain it and help all levels of interested people to learn it. A good doer does not automatically become a good 


Interview's Question: Is it possible to have a computer without critical section?
Alan's kay Answer: Somebody (a gremlin?) changed the question after my answer to include the word “multiprocessing” (which makes a different context).

New answer is still “more or less yes”, but with a few twists. For example, some of the earliest multiprocessing was done 


Interview's Question: What is the origin of model-view-controller?
Alan's kay Answer: Ivan Sutherland — the inventor-originator of interactive computer graphics — had the idea of a clipping window to see a part of the very large Sketchpad world. This wound up being a program structure roughly like a camera which had an aperture that could 


Interview's Question: What was the output of the computer when there was no screen and speaker?
Alan's kay Answer: My vote for the first really working programmable computer is the EDSAC by Maurice Wilkes. One of its intrinsic output devices was three CRT display tubes that looked at various portions of the machine, including the memory.



Using bits in memory to sho


Interview's Question: Computer Scientists: if you had to recommend just a single book to try and teach someone computer science what would it be?
Alan's kay Answer: My parallel to this question would be to replace “computer science” with “Physics”.

60 plus years ago when I went to college, good answers would have been “Sears and Zemansky” or “Halliday and Resnick”. These were both thick tomes aimed at more than a ye


Interview's Question: Can they discover a way for programming digital devices without programming languages? If yes, like what?
Alan's kay Answer: Punched card machines, e.g. from IBM were digital devices that were programmed with plug board wiring, not programming languages. Some of them were quite capable.


I did a little of this in the early 60s before learning the 1401 in the Air Force …


Interview's Question: The dominant paradigm is modern programming languages is Object-Oriented. Why should developers abandon this paradigm and adopt Golang if their application doesn't have huge number of concurrent IO requests?
Alan's kay Answer: As I tried to point out in a previous answer, I don’t think that “object-oriented” is a “programming paradigm”; instead it is a way to define computational things at will (because the building blocks are semantically whole computers). So it is basically a


Interview's Question: What does a computer without an operating system look like?
Alan's kay Answer: Like many computers of the late 40s, the 50s, and into the 60s. They were “bare” HW plus a few external utility programs, for example, the IBM 1401, or early DEC computers.

Sometimes one would write what today might be called a “mini-operating system” to


Interview's Question: How did Ada start programming when computers were not invented?
Alan's kay Answer: You don’t need a computer to write a program, or to execute it. For example, an early algorithm that was done by hand for many years was the greatest common divider (one of the earliest is attributed to Euclid).

One of Ada’s programs was how one would co


Interview's Question: What guidelines would Alan Kay recommend to model something confusing?
Alan's kay Answer: First, is the area “intrinsically confusing” or can the modeling clear things up?

I think of most things that have a “systems nature” as being the former, so I like the idea of “multiple covering heuristics” that together can handle the errors etc of the


Interview's Question: What paradigm is the successor to OOP?
Alan's kay Answer: “OOP” (as I think of it at least) is not really a programming paradigm, but is much more a workable “universal definition” scheme, and that is especially suited for defining large systems.

It is basically an abstraction of an unlimited number of complete


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think about Douglas Lenat's Cyc?
Alan's kay Answer: CYC is such a large complex and long lasting effort, that it doesn’t fit within the scope of a Quora answer. But as with most artifacts in computing, commentary can be somewhat separated into the *idea* of a system, and the processes to *implement* the sy


Interview's Question: Where does Alan Kay see computing in both science and industry going, in terms of systems and how we think about them?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ve been much more effective at doing things than in armchair predicting, so I don’t know what to say here.

Over the last several years I’ve been asked to do a number of talks on “Software Engineering” (they are on YouTube), and each talk took on differ


Interview's Question: What's the point of life?
Alan's kay Answer: The point of life is to live life with a point


Interview's Question: Has Alan Kay voiced any opinions about cryptoeconomics, blockchains, and related "crypto" ideas currently gaining a lot of exposure?
Alan's kay Answer: I haven’t. I feel I need more supported opinions — right now I have “feelings”


Interview's Question: Is it true that the first computer was a loom? How is a loom a computer?
Alan's kay Answer: Here is an answer that specifically covers your question about looms: How was the first computer operating system made if there were no programming languages?


Interview's Question: How and when did digital computers come into existence?
Alan's kay Answer: This question needs to be crisped up a bit. “Digital” happened before computing. And many computers were not programmable. Computing was done long before computing machinery was made and worked.

Etc.

Lots of people realized it was possible, and wanted i


Interview's Question: What do you think about the idea of writing at least parts of law (some legal acts) in a technical language that would actually be a programming language? (So "computable law")
Alan's kay Answer: I got asked to give a keynote last year at the Stanford FutureLaw conference on Computational Law (yes there is one). Start at 1:25 if needed.


Interview's Question: All of the existing programming languages are based on English. And some are far more problematic, as seen by the code poem "Black Perl." What would an inclusive, progressive programming language look like?
Alan's kay Answer: Start by looking at “chimera” artificial languages, such as Esperanto or Interlingua. Personally, I don’t think this helps much if at all for programming.


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think are the most interesting people, projects, and organizations working on education today?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m not comprehensive enough to give a good answer. But the most interesting computer related one is definitely Bret Victor’s “Dynamicland” (check it out on YouTube).


Interview's Question: Why did the designers of Smalltalk decide not to have traditional operator precedence for basic arithmetic? Did this decision lead to a more efficient interpreter?
Alan's kay Answer: For the same reason as Ken Iverson chose for APL. When you have an operator rich expression language, it’s better to have one rule than 100. Lisp did it the other way: by explicitly showing the bracketing of scope.


Interview's Question: Why did Dijkstra say that “Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could only have originated in California.”?
Alan's kay Answer: When I heard this, I thought it was really funny for a number of reasons — Edsger and I were friendly (via Bob Barton) and he loved to come up with snide funny comments.

However, he certainly knew Nygaard and Dahl (of Simula fame) and that they were Norw


Interview's Question: How might computer science evolve to be worthy of winning a Field Medal or a Nobel Prize?
Alan's kay Answer: Or vice versa? That would be interesting also.

In any case, it is strongly rumored that Nobel didn’t like mathematicians, so for whatever reason there is no Nobel for math.

And there is this to contemplate (which equates a variety of prizes that the Nob


Interview's Question: What are Dijkstra's major objectives for the development of structured programs?
Alan's kay Answer: It’s very difficult to do sufficient justice to Edsger. Besides being a foundational computer scientist — in the original strict senses of the term — he was also one of just a few critical gadflies for our whole field, and especially both CS and SE.

Interview's Question: What were interviews like at Xerox PARC?
Alan's kay Answer: In brief: in the first few years of Parc, Bob Taylor wanted “only top people” (meaning “really top people”), and wanted to eliminate rivalries as much as possible.

So he set up a laborious process in which everyone had to interview a candidate, and then 


Interview's Question: Why is human communication being advanced by so many revolutionary and very popular technologies while human collaboration isn't? In order to communicate, one must first collaborate, right? Why so much help to "share" and (almost?) none to promise?
Alan's kay Answer: There is a lot of excellent content related to this question already on Quora.

It’s worth pondering two built-in human drives — competition and cooperation — and how they have played out in various cultures over history. We are social, and both want to (


Interview's Question: Who is the person to whom the invention of the computer is really credited to? There are different views on this particular issue; Alan Turing, John Von Neumann, Charles Babbage?
Alan's kay Answer: Goethe once wrote: “We should all share in the excitement of discovery, without vain attempts to claim priority”. I like this because it invites celebration of many ideas from many sources at many times. And it also still allows us to identify real “super


Interview's Question: Why do some media amplify cognition more than others?
Alan's kay Answer: A comprehensive answer is beyond the size of a Quora response.

But we are “thinking” all the time, and part of our thinking is highly influenced by the information given to us by our senses: especially kinesthetics/touch, visual/configurative, symbols. T


Interview's Question: How can I incorporate a historic/literary approach to a topic about computer science?
Alan's kay Answer: I like to bring in important events in the history of computing when writing about contemporary issues. The main reason is that a very high percentage of computerists are quite ignorant of what has happened — especially since things got rolling in the 40s


Interview's Question: According to Alan Kay, LISP's metacircular interpreter serves as the "Maxwell's equations of software". What are then the Einstein's field equations of software?
Alan's kay Answer: I think I said “Maxwell’s Equations of programming” … and I think this metaphor works pretty well for the late 50s and early 60s when Lisp appeared. It showed “in one eyeful” a very powerful way to model a superset of the kind of programming that was bein


Interview's Question: What did people at Xerox PARC think of the work Apple was doing?
Alan's kay Answer: Here is a different way things could have gone …

The three largest intertwined visions of the computer future we were committed to, all burst into view in 1962: Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad, Doug Engelbart’s “Augmenting Human Intellect”, and Licklider’s “


Interview's Question: How did people at Xerox PARC navigate dealing with the corporate side of Xerox?
Alan's kay Answer: There were different personalities at Parc with differing relationships and needs with corporate; likewise, Xerox was a large rich corporation with many divisions and somewhat like “England before the Magna Carta”.

So some relationships were cordial, som


Interview's Question: How was software complexity changing as new technologies were introduced from machine code, through assembler to high-level languages and beyond?
Alan's kay Answer: A too short but pretty accurate answer is that HLL languages and architectures “almost always” lagged the demands of the software, and this resulted in more complexity than could have been the case.

Some of the exceptions are interesting. E.g. the B5000 


Interview's Question: What is the idea that is better than semphores from John McCarthy in 60s? KEYNOTE 1: Alan Kay - Rethinking Design, Risk, and software watching this on YouTube 38:00

Interview's Question: Why hasn't Xerox PARC explored the stylus in the Alto era?
Alan's kay Answer: We did aim for the stylus at Parc, and this was from experience with the GRAIL system at RAND especially (and GRAIL featured dragging via a stylus).

My thesis project — The Flex Machine — also had a stylus/tablet that was less expensive than RAND’s and n


Interview's Question: Why didn't Alan Kay show up when Adele Goldberg arranged the meeting with Carl Helmers in PARC?
Alan's kay Answer: First, I’ve heard of it. When was the meeting?


Interview's Question: Why was there a mismatch between Xerox management and PARC?
Alan's kay Answer: Parc was set up in mid-1970 as an initiative of the Chief Scientist Jack Goldman and backed by CEO Peter McCullough.

Bob Taylor — former ARPA director, and funder of the ARPAnet — was hired ca Sept ’70 to set up the computing research lab. He was interes

Alan's kay Answer: I couldn’t possibly be …


Interview's Question: How is it that "coding" is a superior term to "conceptualize", if they mean essentially the same?
Alan's kay Answer: As far as my 60+ years of experience goes, the two terms don’t at all mean the same.

In the 50s and 60s especially, “coding” was the act of writing code, and was distinct from “programming” which included design, and often in terms of an abstract framewo


Interview's Question: What is Alan Kay's opinion on the Akka actor library?
Alan's kay Answer: Hard to have an opinion without trying something major.

However, I like the idea of “actors” for a number of reasons (a) they are a reflection of the way I thought about “object-oriented message passing systems” in the 60s, and instigated Carl Hewitt’s w


Interview's Question: How do I master the art of Smalltalk?
Alan's kay Answer: Let’s widen the question to: “How can I understand and use Smalltalk-like language/systems?”

A few basic ideas here are:

One way to model any system is via parts/wholes relationships where a part can be a whole system, and relationships are in terms of 


Interview's Question: Are there any known jazz guitarists who prefer playing on nylon string guitars, and if so, why do they prefer it, the sound or the feel of the instrument?
Alan's kay Answer: Sure: e.g. Charlie Byrd and more. I was a jazz guitarist who later learned classical, and much later started experimenting with jazz on classical. Basically, with my small hands, it was tough to do a lot of the jazz “reaches” on the classical instrument, 


Interview's Question: What is the main difference between a software engineer and a Computer scientist?
Alan's kay Answer: Worth starting with “differences between Engineering and Science, in general”.

Engineering was able to predate Science by thousands of years because “things can be made/repaired/etc. in principled ways” without having to understand just why a working thi


Interview's Question: How can I implement an online microtonal adjustment algorithm to get more perfect harmonics with a method to avoid drift?
Alan's kay Answer: We did just that at Parc in the 70s, and not very completely. Today it could be done much better (and probably has been).

The idea is to try to imitate what singers and players of instruments that can shift pitch microtonally (bowed strings, winds, etc.)


Interview's Question: What are the mental models, biases, and fallacies that software developers should know?
Alan's kay Answer: Only 17?


Interview's Question: Is there a more precise way to describe software than with programming languages?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m using the definition that “a programming language is something that can take a representation and turn it into something that a computer can carry out”. But we could also think of a language that can describe processes that don’t run on a computer (th


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think about computer algebra system (e.g. SymPy and SageMath) usage in mathematics education, before graduate school? Would widespread use of powered cognition assists like these rot younger students' brains as some people fear?
Alan's kay Answer: “Education” and “Training” have some overlap — along the lines of “understanding” and “doing” — but the distinctions are quite useful to keep in mind. In all cases we want something beneficial to change/grow in the mind of the learner.

This implies that 


Interview's Question: What was the world’s first high level programming language in 1957?
Alan's kay Answer: Is this really two questions?

The simple answer is FORTRAN: it was by far the most developed, polished, and optimized HLL as of 1957.

At the next — less simple — level are quite a few things in the works.

Besides what Grace Hopper was doing — e.g. with


Interview's Question: Is it possible to create imaginary atoms of matter on a computer using only software graphics?
Alan's kay Answer: I typed “simulated atoms” into YouTube and got many different videos showing various levels of physical simulations of atoms rendered using “software graphics”.

Several of these show actual constructed atoms from elementary particles. My favorite was the


Interview's Question: What do you think of RMOX operating system from U Kent in England? I am amazed it is 32 bit only and not 64 bit (maybe secretly used by Englands government) https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/ofa/kroc/rmox-cpa.pdf
Alan's kay Answer: This is a “CSP” influenced design. I don’t like to criticize unless I’m willing to do it in substantiated detail, so I’ll just say here that there are other styles for dealing with concurrent modules that I like more.


Interview's Question: I want to understand and learn Lisp. I saw one of your YouTube videos where you said few understand it even today. What is the best way to learn Lisp and the creation of really good software that like the internet is reliable?
Alan's kay Answer: Lisp presents itself as “a kernel language with a library” and as a “metalanguage” and “metasystem”. It’s the latter that I think few in computing — in terms of percentages — have taken the trouble to learn and ponder deeply.

There are two main aspects t


Interview's Question: Are business interests and principled engineering often at odds?
Alan's kay Answer: Take a look at “Challenger” and Thiokol, and the 737 Max and Boeing — as starters …



Interview's Question: What would "software CAD/SIM" look like?
Alan's kay Answer: Let’s try as close an analogy to modern Engineering (with a Big “E”) as we can. One of the processes is called CAD<->SIM<->FAB(rication), and the idea is to solve as many design problems as possible in the CAD<->SIM part.

CAD is a set of tools for making


Interview's Question: Has Lisp ever been implemented iteratively?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m not sure I understand this question clearly.

But the first implementation by Steve Russell — and many since — was done by writing a loop that manipulated structures in memory to create the equivalent of a recursive eval-apply. Take a look at the latt


Interview's Question: What language was ALGOL 58 written in?
Alan's kay Answer: “BALGOL” (Burroughs Algol) was a version of Algol 58 that was implemented on the Burroughs 205 and 220 computers in pretty much the same machine code — the two machines were quite similar (good portions of this by Don Knuth).


Interview's Question: How does one get as close as possible to mastering software engineering?
Alan's kay Answer: “Engineering” is making something in a principled way — so there is definitely a “software engineering” of a sort.

The idea was articulated in the 1960s as a *aspiration* because the “principled ways” known in computing did not compare strongly with wher


Interview's Question: What are the limitations discovered in the early programming language that triggered the need for OOP?
Alan's kay Answer: The earliest programming was in the forms of the earliest computers: to find resources in memory — usually numbers, or numbers standing for something (like a text character) — and doing something with them: often changing them or making something and putt


Interview's Question: Did Xerox PARC have time constraints?
Alan's kay Answer: I was not aware of any during the period I was there, from late ’70 to ‘81.

However, we did often put them on our own projects — and for various reasons. For example, when we decided to make our own PDP-10 when corporate nixed buying one and wanted Parc 


Interview's Question: Did the Xerox PARC children had any problems context-switching between traditional math precedence rules and Smalltalk alternative left-to-right evaluation order? Would Mathematics change significantly if left-to-right evaluation were widely adopted?
Alan's kay Answer: We made the decision not to have precedence for the very same reason APL did: if you have lots of operators, just remembering precedence starts to become a burden. The kids had no trouble dealing with the (easier) left to right “consumption” idea, and I n


Interview's Question: How can a beginner develop thinking (computational and algorithmic) in programming?
Alan's kay Answer: This question was asked by “Leonardo da Vinci”, and I wouldn’t like to deprive Leonardo of the pleasure of finding this out for himself.

Now that we’ve had some fun with this, here are a few contextual perspectives to get you started …

“computational” a


Interview's Question: What are some examples that demonstrate the usefulness of homoiconicity in programming?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t think it is that useful per se (the most important aspects of a programming language are to have both (a) the most powerful semantic frameworks for expressing meaning, and (b) to be as learnable and readable and “gistable” as possible for human us


Interview's Question: What caused the ADA to be created?
Alan's kay Answer: The Wikipedia article is a good place to start: Ada (programming language) - Wikipedia High-level programming language first released in 1980 Ada Paradigm Multi-paradigm : structured , imperative , object-oriented , aspect-oriented , [ 1 ] concurrent , ar


Interview's Question: To what extent does each invention require the invention of jargon for that invention?
Alan's kay Answer: Great question!

I like a process that seems generally unpopular, but has been extremely useful in science especially: that is to try to coin special words for the special new meanings, and part of getting fluent in the new knowledge is to get fluent with


Interview's Question: What is the best book for Research Methods in Computing?
Alan's kay Answer: It would be fun and illuminating to see the opinions of others — either as answers or comments here.

The best book about the ARPA-IPTO/Parc research community (1962–1982 or so) is “The Dream Machine” by Mitchell Waldrop (it has been brought back into pri


Interview's Question: Did Alan Kay give advice to Guido van Rossum on the design of Python? The language is said to have a object model that leans toward the original late-binding, kaynesian definition, instead of the abstract datatypes route taken by e.g. Java and C++.
Alan's kay Answer: I didn’t give Guido any advice on the design of Python. The aims of Python and its early history are easy to find with Google. Guido also wrote a blog with many articles about different aspects of Python history and development.


Interview's Question: In software engineering, when might pragmatism be harmful in the short term?
Alan's kay Answer: Almost always. As Don Knuth wrote long ago “Premature optimization is the root of all evil”.

If the term “engineering” is to mean anything in “software engineering”, the higher priorities all have to do with the longer term life cycle requirements of the


Interview's Question: Did Atari use the Forth language for any of their software?
Alan's kay Answer: I was there from late 1981 to early 1984, and was not aware that FORTH was used in any Atari systems. However, it is certainly possible that a use escaped my notice.


Interview's Question: Is it important to turn what is actually needed into a pop culture?
Alan's kay Answer: I think “just the opposite”. It’s important to turn pop cultures into “what is actually needed”.


Interview's Question: Did UNIX fulfill or exceed the vision of the Multics project?
Alan's kay Answer: I thought Paul Green provided a good answer to a related question. Why did Unix succeed and not Multics? https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Unix-succeed-and-not-Multics The question here is about “the vision” of the two systems. I think that the Multics effort


Interview's Question: What are some good books about what is actually needed in software engineering?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ve been trying to find some (I got invited to do a keynote at a large upcoming Software Engineering conference, and have been looking to see if there is more of a consensus and higher level view already in the literature).

So far … one observation of w


Interview's Question: What is your review of The Pragmatic Programmer (1999 book)?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t have a detailed memory of the details of this 1999 book, but do remember some impressions.

The main one was that it — correctly I thought — addressed “programmers” in general as people who had not learned or done engineering in their past or as p


Interview's Question: Can processes notify operating system that their stack and heap will need this much of memory prior to starting? Or is it operating system's decision to give a predetermined amount of space for heap and stack for every process?
Alan's kay Answer: Here is one of the many great ideas in the “Project Genie” OS (lead designer: Butler Lampson, and later used to launch commercial time-sharing, and for the Engelbart “Mother Of All Demos” towards the end of the 1960s).

The SDS computer was a 24-bit 0.5 M


Interview's Question: What is objective quality?
Alan's kay Answer: Try typing it into Google and looking at the first hit (that’s what I did …)


Interview's Question: How was personal computing influenced by the hippie movement?
Alan's kay Answer: The larger category of interest here is “the counterculture”, of which the hippies could be considered one branch (or possibly a parallel “counterculture”). For example, I think “The Whole Earth Catalog” is a “counterculture” medium rather than a “hippie”


Interview's Question: In the STEPS report, an unresolved problem of massive intermodule coordination and communication is mentioned. Is it more of a hardware problem, or a software/design problem?
Alan's kay Answer: For a long time, this was a problem that never quite got worked on — it lost out to other problems — but one I thought “someone” should do (maybe us).

I tossed it into the list of techniques that would make STEPS interesting, and again, it didn’t quite m


Interview's Question: Could some kind of analogy be made up between object-orientation and set theory?
Alan's kay Answer: At Parc, we put some thought into this. One idea was to see about relationships between the set of objects you retrieve in a search and that a Smalltalk class generates a set of objects which obey the description in the class.

One way to look at this is 


Interview's Question: Can the concept of Unix pipes be added to apps and GUI's?
Alan's kay Answer: The “pipe” idea in Unix was originated by Doug McIlroy in the early 70s, but the notion of interprocess communication was much earlier, and one of the first systems to use interprocess communication (and to invent “data-flow programming”) was by Bert Suth


Interview's Question: What is the relationship among programming paradigm, object-oriented programming, and event-driven programming?
Alan's kay Answer: “OOP”, especially in its original form, is a comprehensive way to define any computational idea by using intercommunicating entities that are a single kind of universal building block with the semantics of a whole computer.

One of the most natural ways i


Interview's Question: What's the difference between levels and paradigms in programming? Can we talk about declarative and imperative paradigms only when talking about high level programming languages?
Alan's kay Answer: Most computers in history, including most today, are set up to have many of their lowest level instructions be “commands” (in other words “imperative”), and especially with regard to rewriting lowest level memories.

A “declarative” form at the lowest lev


Interview's Question: What progress have computer scientists made toward solving the symbol grounding problem?
Alan's kay Answer: Excellent question! Simple answers are “some”, “not a lot”, and “not a lot of work is going on these days on this problem”. (Note that David Vanderschel’s answer indicates that he thinks “imitations” by ML systems (ML as Judea Pearl points out is an exten


Interview's Question: Would a computer scientist from 1985 understand an iPhone and how it worked? Would they be able to take it apart and advance our civilization?
Alan's kay Answer: 1. Sure
2. Remove Twitter and Facebook?


Interview's Question: What elements of syntax should always be taken into account?
Alan's kay Answer: “Syntax” is the position of something relative to the position of something else. It can be any dimension. It’s usually thought of as 1-dimension (as a string of characters or words, etc.) but in a GUI, quite a bit has to do with nearness and enclosures, 


Interview's Question: How does a desktop environment work? How does a GUI work? Does the OS recognize where the mouse is and on top of what? Does it depend on the pixels color?
Alan's kay Answer: Here is the entire memory of the Xerox Parc Alto computer in the early 70s showing every bit. You can see that half of it was used to hold the bits (1 bit per pixel) that would show up on the 606x808 screen as black or white pixels). And here’s the Alto i


Interview's Question: What's the best way of combining functional and OO programming in practice?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m assuming that the terms in the question are contemporary “code words” for very particular practices that now have the labels “functional programming” and “object-oriented programming”.

I’m going to use much older and more original meanings. For examp


Interview's Question: How did Smalltalk-80 manage to work with only 32,000 objects maximum (roughly)?
Alan's kay Answer: The simplest answers are that “it had to” and “we really wanted it to” and “we had Dan Ingalls”. The Alto computer (April 1973) for many years only had 128KB of RAM, organized as 64K 16 bit words, and roughly half of this was used for the 800x600 bit-map 


Interview's Question: Is Object-Oriented Analysis to object-oriented design an easy transition?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m pretty sure I don’t understand this question.

I think *design* in general is extremely difficult to do well. Most things that can be designed have a systems nature, and a good perspective on this will quite often lead to organizations that can be ren


Interview's Question: Papers about the Smalltalk history refer to the importance of the Xerox Alto's design as a "meta-computer", in which many unanticipated needs could be emulated in microcode. Why modern computer architectures are not microcoded?
Alan's kay Answer: The idea of microcode was invented by Maurice Wilkes, a great pioneer who arguably made the earliest programmable computer — the EDSAC (pace Manchester Baby). The idea depends partly on the existence of a “large enough” memory that is much faster (3–10 ti


Interview's Question: Who created the first computer with GUI and in which language?
Alan's kay Answer: Both of the “earliest” British computers — Cambridge EDSAC, Manchester Baby and Mark I — had electrostatic CRTs, which could show a limited 2D bit-map of part of storage, and both soon were used for games. But I have never been able to find any mention of


Interview's Question: When hobbyists built their own computers back in the 70s what applications did they write?
Alan's kay Answer: That was a tough time for personal computing. Amongst the disenfranchised, there was a hunger for participation, and most did not have access or the funds to rent time-sharing terminals.

At Parc we were lucky to have the funding and a few geniuses to be 


Interview's Question: What are the pitfalls in implementing QFD?
Alan's kay Answer: In *Marketing* “the customer is always right”. In *Education* “the customer doesn’t know enough and needs to be taught stronger ideas”.

Most of the important computer technologies in use today — Internet, personal computing, GUIs, etc. — were not thought


Interview's Question: What was the problem that HyperCard solved?
Alan's kay Answer: The question should be rephrased as “For what vital parts of Personal Computing was HyperCard a great advance?”

“Personal Computing” and “Personal Computers” were mostly conceived and defined by the ARPA-IPTO/Parc research community of the 60s and 70s, b


Interview's Question: Are DSLs a good way to represent complex object hierarchies?
Alan's kay Answer: This question seems to assume that “complex object hierarchies” are worth better representation schemes.

I think the more important question of good ways to describe “things that you would like to have instances of” is the one that needs to be treated fi


Interview's Question: How is the food at CU Boulder?
Alan's kay Answer: I graduated from CU Boulder in 1966, so hope there is no food from back then still around! I was a “starving student” back then so my options were limited.


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think about the Commodore Amiga (1985) as a multimedia computer or an appealing tool for artists? How does it compare with Alto or Star, or with Sierra machine Atari was working on as you were Chief Scientist at SRL?
Alan's kay Answer: I haven’t found a good history of all this — but there might be one somewhere. It is a very complex set of interactions and much of the context needed to get a good picture is beyond the scope of a Quora answer. Part of the complexity is due to the many i


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think about considering the creation of software as a design activity, putting it as a third item on the same level as science and art?
Alan's kay Answer: This is another case, where instead of a simple question, what is needed are “10 Things” and “20 examples”.


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think about Problem Frames (by Michael Jackson)?
Alan's kay Answer: I try to avoid either praising or criticizing areas that I have not spent some time in dealing with the details. This is one of them. I remember reading at least one of Jackson’s books on his approach to Requirements (but I’ve been living quite a bit in L


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think about the following research proposal notes about a new software world? (https://osoco.es/thoughts/2020/06/notes-about-a-new-software-world/)
Alan's kay Answer: We definitely need a new software world …

I think I can give almost the same answers to both of your recent questions.

Two heuristics I’ve used for more than 50 years now when thinking about “something major”, are first, to try to “write 10 things” abou


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think about the development of software libraries adopting Seymour Papert's constructivism and "microworlds" concepts as described in these articles?
Alan's kay Answer: “Sure!”

I think I can give almost the same answers to both of your recent questions.

Two heuristics I’ve used for more than 50 years now when thinking about “something major”, are first, to try to “write 10 things” about it, and then to “write 20 exampl


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think of the "programming as interaction" perspective? (http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/programming-interaction/)
Alan's kay Answer: As the author of the blog — Tomas Petricek — mentions, Smalltalk 50 years ago had a very large number of the things he wants to do (and still does).

However, it is possible that he is not aware of earlier — and even larger along some dimensions — work by


Interview's Question: What will be the potential of a Smalltalk system based on declarative programming instead of imperative?
Alan's kay Answer: Could it then be called a “Smalltalk”?

I think the key phrase here is “based on”, which is used instead of “including” (which it already does).

Still, I think that having a really well tooled and hefty subset of a language be “declarative” would be bene


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think of a new Smalltalk system more focused on the problem than in the solution space (e.g., using the ideas proposed by Michael Jackson or David Harel)?
Alan's kay Answer: Any highly extensible language can be made into what was called a “Problem Oriented Language” (POL) in the 60s (and many of the languages back then were in fact POLs — even Algol).

Most languages can be programmed to exhibit any semantics, so I think the


Interview's Question: Are there other "it's turtles all the way down" programming languages apart from the Lisps and Smalltalks?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m not sure exactly what you mean by “turtles all the way down” here. It is sometimes used with regard to Smalltalk because every kind of entity in it is a Smalltalk object.

Using this as a guide, we could observe that in certain languages centered arou


Interview's Question: What happened to the children exposed to Smalltalk at an early age in Xerox PARC, back in the 1970s-1980s? Did some of them grow to become great programmers/scientists. Do they use Smalltalk to this day? Or was there just no follow-up study?
Alan's kay Answer: There were no follow-up studies (we couldn’t even get funding from either Xerox or NSF to do the longitudinal learning experiments that we thought were crucial to the research).

And anecdotes are fun, but not much more than that. For example, the Goldeen


Interview's Question: Why do many projects done by computer researchers (eg. Bret Victor or the VPRI) remain closed-source, even though papers get published about them?
Alan's kay Answer: Because many kinds of experimentation are aimed at finding out things, not to produce tools for others to use. This is especially true in the user interface area, where a large number of different experiments are required with different kinds of users, an


Interview's Question: What would be the necessary elements for setting up a biomedical equivalent to PARC?
Alan's kay Answer: Before I write too much, I need to know if you are familiar with Janelia Labs (near Dulles Airport in Virginia). Janelia Research Campus - Wikipedia Research institute in Virginia, USA Janelia Research Campus is a scientific research campus of the Howard 


Interview's Question: Why were nearly all the cases of early computers made of plastics?
Alan's kay Answer: “Early” as in “actually early”? As in 1945 to the 1970s? Or “early” as in “relative to your age”?

“Actually early” were basically metal as far as I know and mostly by direct experience. The Control Data 3600 (ca 1963) on which I spent a few years, had a 


Interview's Question: What should be learned to deeply understand the 20th and 21st centuries?
Alan's kay Answer: Eric Naughton’s answer is very much pointed in a fruitful direction.

A more general observation is that most human beings since our species started prowling the planet have been content with made up stories about themselves and their kind. This is partly


Interview's Question: When you say, "the computer revolution hasn't happened yet" do you mean that in the sense that, "the printing press hasn't been invented yet" or that, "the printing press has been invented but it will take time before a, "literary culture" emerges?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ve done a number of talks and written a few essays on this subject — these will give a more expansive answer.

I usually invoke a number of “thinkers about writing and printing” such as Marshall McLuhan, Frank Smith, etc., to set up what I think is a us


Interview's Question: How did they program the first computer knowing that programming a computer requires a computer?
Alan's kay Answer: There’s writing the program, and there’s getting the program into the computer in a form that will run it. In “the old days” — not just in antiquity, but well into the 60s — most programs were written on paper before being punched on cards or typed into i


Interview's Question: How much about physics, mechanics, and electronics should a computer scientist know about?
Alan's kay Answer: I think it’s a very good idea for computerists to have done the work to attain deep fluency in a well established scientific discipline (Physics is a good one). Most people in computing use the “science” in “computer science” more like “library science” t


Interview's Question: How often does Alan Kay find that the real problem is found at a level of abstraction that can’t be addressed by individuals, such as ‘the human condition’ or ‘societal values’?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m not sure about all of the question, so please comment to explain more.

Generally speaking the “real problem” is almost always “the human condition” and/or “societal values”.

But these problems can be addressed by both individuals and groups — for ex


Interview's Question: Were all Wirth languages Algol-like (e.g. Pascal), or were any of them Lisp-like, or even something completely different?
Alan's kay Answer: A fun question!

Adriaan Van Wijngaarden was one of the earliest and most colorful computer scientists concerned with programming language design. He was on the Algol committees, and was a bit of an agitator, and especially in the directions of generaliza


Interview's Question: Should writing code be fun?
Alan's kay Answer: I wrote this in a comment to Ian Joyner’s answer. Here it is as an answer. Ian used a great quote by Al Perlis (the first Turing Award winner) about “Computer Science”:

"I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in 


Interview's Question: When, and in what degree was today's level of abstraction in programming predicted?
Alan's kay Answer: If you explain just what you mean by “abstraction” here (and “level”), I will be happy to attempt an answer.


Interview's Question: Have you ever studied optical illusions to use similar principles in your UX designs?
Alan's kay Answer: I have studied them quite a bit — as well as many books by research psychologists, including by Richard Gregory, Roger Shepard, etc. But not to use the principles in the UI designs per se, but as one of the most available routes to understand and test the


Interview's Question: I searched YouTube for Alan Kay with Donald Knuth and found nothing. How does Alan Kay understand the essence of literate programming? Is it to design code like you would have to teach it?
Alan's kay Answer: Don and I have been friends for more than 50 years now. The simple summary of “literate programming” is that “Don is amazing”, both in “many ways” and in how he goes about programming, and what he thinks a program *is*.

He wrote a nice short paper and ex


Interview's Question: Is it a good way to get an indirect tip on an invention by looking at a software program running, that is morphing into different shapes? If easier to get ideas this way than language, does that prove our language is too simple and must be developed?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t quite understand the first part of your question, but as to the second part, there is quite a bit of evidence that we have what one of the inventors of cognitive psychology — Jerome Bruner — called “multiple ways of learning and knowing and rememb


Interview's Question: What are the differences between social science, natural science, and humanities?
Alan's kay Answer: Several good answers here already, so this will attempt to add more perspective.

Interview's Question: Are there any areas apart from user interfaces in which the Model - View - Controller (MVC) pattern could be applied in spirit?
Alan's kay Answer: Sure.

I wrote a paper in the late 70s or early 80s dealing with the idea that “everything” — and more — in the kind of object-oriented programming we were doing could be re-created in very useful ways by generalizing “viewing”. This included making objec


Interview's Question: Will plain English ever be a programming language, as in Star Trek?
Alan's kay Answer: My boss at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in the 60s — Glenn Lewis — in the 50s was a Princeton grad student of von Neumann’s, who — among his many personality idiosyncrasies — was famous for pooh-poohing “higher level languages”.

Interview's Question: Why do we use digital computers for machine learning, AI applications, and natural language and speech processing, if our brains are analog not digital, would it be better if we use analog Computing to mimic our brains?
Alan's kay Answer: “Digital” is “Analog handled carefully”. Quite a bit of work in design and technology has to be done to make the noisy voltage levels (or any other means of transmitting a signal) be interpreted as discrete values.

A high percentage of the bits on CDROMs


Interview's Question: What was the first personal computer to use the GUI?
Alan's kay Answer: It is really annoying to have “someone” change a question after it has been answered — especially if the answer no longer fits the new question. That is what happened here. The original question asked about “personal computers” and my answer is below. Now


Interview's Question: I heard today that there are some advantages of using a formal language to write a software specification. What are they?
Alan's kay Answer: All computer languages are “formal languages”, so we want something that will allow us to express the meaning of what we want without pragmatics (unless part of the meaning has requirements for certain pragmatics). We’d like it to be as clear as possible,


Interview's Question: Were Xerox PARC systems like the Star robust for third-party application development?
Alan's kay Answer: As the question is phrased, the answer would be “yes”.

However, at least in the early and main phases of the Star (and I’m guessing: all) there was no intention that any other than Xerox would do applications for the Star.

The robustness came from the w


Interview's Question: How were multi-user programs (e.g., MUDs) implemented on time-share systems? Shared memory? IPC?
Alan's kay Answer: Every which way …

In the sixties there was an attempt to protect large processes from each other using base-bounds registers (which were quite often merged with the hardware used for mapping swappable portions of a virtual memory).

For example, on the S


Interview's Question: Does abstraction in computer science use mathematics as a basis?
Alan's kay Answer: “Mathematics” doesn’t have a crisp definition, and its plural form has admitted many new thinking schemes over the years.

I think we are doing mathematics whenever we are making a concerted effort to relate organizations of ideas to each other (von Neuma


Interview's Question: How does the brain interpret computer languages?
Alan's kay Answer: There is not much definitive understanding about how the brain does most things, including traditional languages, mathematical languages, music, computer languages, etc.

It’s worth noting that virtually all the studies of fluency in any of these have fou


Interview's Question: . Do you agree with Myers and Rosson's statement that 'nearly half of entire software development effort relates to the user interface'? Defend your answer.
Alan's kay Answer: This sounds like a homework assignment.

If you were to read their paper, you’d see that it was written 30 years ago in 1992. Practically the first thing that Brad Myers complains about is that the previous survey dated back to 1978, and there was a need 


Interview's Question: When Alan Kay invented the user interface (screwdriver metaphor), had he in mind disabled people too?
Alan's kay Answer: I didn’t invent the user interface — or the graphical user interface — many of the basic ideas were first invented and implemented in the 50s, and especially in the first half of the 60s — and quite a few of these were done by DoD supported research, espe


Interview's Question: How do computers work? I am 16 and I love programming, but I feel like I should know what really happens on the inside, the physics of it.
Alan's kay Answer: I’ve answered various parts of this question elsewhere in Quora. Try this one to get started. You will see that the fundamental building blocks for making a computer can be made in many ways, and often from completely common materials.

Alan Kay's answer 


Interview's Question: How do computers work the way they do? When does electricity become executable logic and how?
Alan's kay Answer: Many of the answers here have more elements than needed — for example, transistors and how they work are not required. One way to think about digital programmable computers is that they can be completely made from “switchable switches”, that is: switches 


Interview's Question: What would happen if a computer was made for two users, with a monitor in common and two keyboards? Would it make programming more sociable?
Alan's kay Answer: To just pick two gems from the past, take a look at Doug Engelbart and NLS, and Horishi Ishii, especially his work at NTT and “Clearpane”.


Interview's Question: If advanced software is technically just made up of lots of really simple components, why can't we replicate them using AI or no-code platforms?
Alan's kay Answer: Living things are made mostly from 6 simple atoms plus a few trace elements. What’s “interesting” is the unusual organization of them. This is also the main difficulty with software, whether written by humans or other software (i.e. “AI”).


Interview's Question: How is an Operating System run on Transistors? Like how is software put on it and getting a graphical output from all of this?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ve answered much of this question already on Quora. I’ve put a few of these links below. The way to start understanding this is to first see - A - how patterns can be represented by various kinds of “marks”, including in electrical devices such as switc


Interview's Question: What is the revolution of computers?
Alan's kay Answer: Questions similar to this have been asked a few times (I’ve already answered two of them — take a look). And here’s one of the answers: Alan Kay's answer to At OOPSLA 1997 Alan Kay gave a talk titled "The computer revolution hasn't happened yet". What par


Interview's Question: What is a program, and why do computers need programs?
Alan's kay Answer: A “computer” is any system that manipulates information, most often to help generate inferences. It was first used to refer to people who did this, especially in the case where the information was numeric and the inferences were arithmetical.

Some of the


Interview's Question: Is computer science a real science like physics or is it a Cargo Cult Science with fields like machine learning having no deep theory behind it ? Can you explain the reason why computer science is a science?
Alan's kay Answer: I think we have to get to more precision of terms to approach this question. For example, we need to agree at least on what we mean by “Science” and what is meant today by “Computer Science”.

However we define “Science”, we need to include fields such as


Interview's Question: Is there anyone out there capable of writing a guitar tab from audio alone? I have a riff that I really want to play, but I only have 1 video recording of it and think tab would help.
Alan's kay Answer: There is a profession called “take downing” with pros called “take-downers” who listen to music and write out the musical scores of what happened, and what is needed to play it. Most musicians can do this to one extent or another — the pros can do it real


Interview's Question: Should web browsers have stuck to being document viewers?
Alan's kay Answer: Actually quite the opposite, if “document” means an imitation of old static text media (and later including pictures, and audio and video recordings).

It was being willing to settle for an overly simple text format and formatting scheme — “for convenienc


Interview's Question: What old computers were way ahead of their time?
Alan's kay Answer: If the early 80s is “old”, then what are the early 50s or early 60s?

“ca. 1950” Let me submit “Whirlwind”, one of the earliest parallel architectures, and which was designed to be able to do real-time interactions, especially using graphical displays and


Interview's Question: What books would you recommend for an autodidact who is interested in the field of human-computer interaction?
Alan's kay Answer: All learning — in the end — is autodidactic (*we* have to do the work to learn: no one can give us a transfusion). The main thing that is required for any learning is a sense of threshold — *where* you have to get beyond in process, knowledge, skill, etc.


Interview's Question: How old is cloud computing?
Alan's kay Answer: There are always contenders for “first” — which often cannot be reasonably sorted out — so I like to use “early” instead.

I think of “cloud” as a name eventually given to what was earlier called an “information utility” (as an analogy to the electric pow


Interview's Question: What is the history behind Alan Kay’s quote, “Point of view is worth 80 IQ points.”?
Alan's kay Answer: We humans are set up by our nature — and the cultures to which our nature gives rise — to deal with much of our lives and memories in stories and story-like forms. Proverbs are very short stories, and as such they are much more memorable than careful desc


Interview's Question: What was it like programming an IBM 1401 back in the 60’s?
Alan's kay Answer: The IBM 1401 was the first computer I programmed as part of a real job (an enlisted man in the US Air Force at Air Training Command (ATG), Randolph AFB, San Antonio, Texas). In the early 60s, the USAF had a quite difficult aptitude test made for them by I


Interview's Question: If one starts with a state of the art object-oriented programming from the late 80s and early 90s (Smalltalk, Self, CLOS), what could have been the next breakthrough in that style of programming, but never happened?
Alan's kay Answer: For September 1984, I was invited to write the cover article for the Scientific American special issue on “Computer Software” — back in the heyday when SciAm was a much more serious attempt to bridge the gaps between science and the general public. Within


Interview's Question: What is your review of The Dream Machine: J.C.R. Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing Personal?
Alan's kay Answer: Bottom Line: The best single book about the inventions of personal computing and the Internet, as judged by those who were involved. It’s the book I always recommend when people ask for accounts of how much of today’s interactive networked technologies an


Interview's Question: Why is Machine Learning so hard to explain?
Alan's kay Answer: Here is an explanation of “conditioned learning” for complete beginners. How would one explain AI to a complete beginner?


Interview's Question: What would Alan Kay think about a future U.S. President immediately scaling up the circular economy?
Alan's kay Answer: The technical issues are many, longstanding, and systems related — and there are many complications from most Americans not understanding them, or the grave dangers the world has been in for several decades now. If this were a conventional war, the enemie


Interview's Question: What is the best way for 2 independent programs to communicate with each other? One program reading while other program writes to a file? Or opening a local TCP connection and communicate through it? And which is commonly used method?
Alan's kay Answer: This looks like a class homework problem. In any case, it’s the kind of question for which many useful answers are readily available via Google, StackOverflow, etc.


Interview's Question: What is declarative programming?
Alan's kay Answer: One way to think about this is the distinction between “hows” and “whats” (and perhaps a middle ground of “almost whats”).

Historically, programming started in the “how” realm, with the program as the tactics for making the desired effects from the mater


Interview's Question: Should schools be remote learning only until fall 2021?
Alan's kay Answer: New section added Jan 29th 2021

The answer I gave below, unfortunately resembles statements like: “if everyone would just 100% isolate and wear masks, we would soon end the pandemic”. It misses most of what is actually going on, and what is needed to dea


Interview's Question: What are some historic examples of elegant, streamlined operating systems?
Alan's kay Answer: A fabulous super-efficient elegantly designed HW/OS was “Project Genie”, an ARPA Project at Berkeley in the mid to late 60s. Project Genie - Wikipedia

It is most famous for three big uses of it. The first was that it turned out so successfully that ARPA 


Interview's Question: What kind of thought process do you need to understand programming?
Alan's kay Answer: Even if you are programming in a declarative language, you are organizing a structure of interacting relationships whose realization on a computer will cause desired effects to happen.

The next levels of thinking can feel very different, and to such a po


Interview's Question: How do computers deal with images, written texts, videos, etc.? Does it transform them into 0 and 1 codes?
Alan's kay Answer: Yes. A good way to think of this is that a binary digit — a bit — is not really a “0” or a “1” but just “off” or “on” (or “not there” or “there”). In other words, it is like a simple mark on a wall or paper. So a bit is more intuitively represented by sym


Interview's Question: Since programming ultimately comes to controlling computer hardware (even if we don't usually think of it that way), how is it that the same programming languages work on many different type of computers with different hardware?
Alan's kay Answer: A good way to start thinking about this is that most computers are “universal”: meaning that given enough memory and time, they can compute anything that can be computed. This means that — for any imagined effect — there exist combinations of each compute


Interview's Question: What is Alan Kay's MBTI type?
Alan's kay Answer: Astrology posits 12 “types”. But this particular sorting doesn’t work well, so “epicycles” are introduced, and these allow pretty much any observed fact to be rationalized to the system.

Myers-Briggs is more interesting in a number of ways, but also even


Interview's Question: Since everything can be represented by objects, what is the successor of Smalltalk? What system could be comparably minimal, yet more powerful?
Alan's kay Answer: Kernel systems that are written in themselves — like Lisp or Smalltalk — can morph into any new idea and claim that “the potential” was always there …

But just to start readers thinking about this, a number of the “details” of how Smalltalk was implement


Interview's Question: What are the five features of the object-oriented paradigm that you consider to be important for good software engineering practice?
Alan's kay Answer: “Engineering” is the *principled* process of creating working systems that are in accord with both our immediate goals and requirements, and also in accord with contextual requirements (such as integrity, safety, predictability, maintainability, etc).

Interview's Question: How much computer science knowledge has been lost because it was not published or documented, or no working code has been shared?
Alan's kay Answer: If truly lost, then we can’t know enough to answer the question in any era.

Given that the vast majority (this is an estimate from personal experience) has never taken the trouble to even type “E n g e l b a r t” into Google and look closely at even the 


Interview's Question: What is Seed7 programming language about?
Alan's kay Answer: With programming languages, quite a bit of assessment should be done by writing various kinds of systems (and especially “reference systems”). I haven’t done that, so I’ve little to say here.

I did find that Seed7 is closely based on the theses of Thomas


Interview's Question: Does Alan Kay know about Brightmark? The company that is taking recycled waste and making renewable fuel. The company already partnered with BP. If not, I hope this reaches him.
Alan's kay Answer: Yes, I am aware of Brightmark, but not in detail.

Interview's Question: I’ve been quite interested in playing the lyre, but I have no knowledge on it and since it’s not a very popular instrument, there aren’t guides. My question is, what’s a good amount of strings? I see 7 string, 10 string, 16 string etc., so which?
Alan's kay Answer: Yes, I am aware of Brightmark, but not in detail.

For the last several years I have been helping The Ellen MacArthur Foundation of the UK, a non-profit that is highly concerned with the climate, waste, circular economy, etc. Circular Economy - UK, USA, E


Interview's Question: Does Alan Kay know or even have met Russell Ackoff on Idealized Design?
Alan's kay Answer: My introduction to systems thinking outside of computing came from a few science fiction books in the 50s, reading a lot of the Cybernetics literature, being a molecular biology major in the early 60s, and then reading quite a few books that were listed i


Interview's Question: Would artificial intelligence be possible if computer programming was not invented?
Alan's kay Answer: Here’s a somewhat different perspective on this.

“Artificial” means something *made* (usually by humans). “Intelligence” is more difficult to pin down — humans like to think that they are, so let’s take an informal view of this.

So “artificial intellige


Interview's Question: Have you ever been asked to teach someone how to program computers by a person with no such background and how did you respond?
Alan's kay Answer: This hasn’t happened for some years now, but I’ve always tried to help them (we all started “with no such background” …).

The two main parts are “what does it mean to do something at all”, and “what does it mean to make and interact with systems”. *

Interview's Question: How was the first graphical user interface (GUI) made on a computer in the absence of any other graphic software?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m writing this because the 4 already existing answers — well meaning perhaps — range from being “pretty wrong” to “very wrong”. They all appear to have been done without any checking of history (and are perhaps mostly “just made up” from scraps that the


Interview's Question: Why is it so important to invent the future from the future rather than incrementing from the present?
Alan's kay Answer: Incrementing from the present and inventing in the future both have their useful niches.

My research community — ARPA/Parc in the 60s and 70s — was aimed at qualitative changes that were quite distant from increments, for example: the Internet and Ethern


Interview's Question: Has the real computer revolution happened yet?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ve answered versions of this question before on Quora.

In my research community — ARPA/Parc in the 60s and 70s — “computer revolution” meant something like the next qualitative leap from the “writing, printing, math and science” revolution. In other wo


Interview's Question: How was version control handled in the early days of PARC?
Alan's kay Answer: “In the early days of Parc” would be when there were Altos, Ethernet, Laser Printer service, but not yet a comprehensive set of remote file services. (I’m leaving out here the simulated PDP-10 mainframe — “MAXC” — that we built, which had quite a few vers


Interview's Question: Why isn't meta-programming more common in software development?
Alan's kay Answer: There are 4 existing answers as I write this, each of which has something useful to say.

“Meta-programming” at least means “programming the programming system” you are using to add features the programming system doesn’t possess.

Note that vanilla proce


Interview's Question: If the two digits of a number are multiplied together, the result is one third of the number itself. What is the number?
Alan's kay Answer: 15 = 1x5x3


Interview's Question: Is it mostly a myth that computing advancements happened in a garage?
Alan's kay Answer: Well, HP started in a home garage, but their computer advances didn’t.

Apple famously started in a home garage — here we have to stretch what I’d call a “computer advancement” to cover this. But here is what Woz said about this:

“The garage is a bit of 


Interview's Question: Why did 4th Generation programming languages like SuperTalk not catch on?
Alan's kay Answer: I would not call SuperTalk a “4th Generation” Language, but a “different generation” language.

The system that SuperTalk operated within was called “SuperCard”. It was essentially derived directly from Hypercard, and tried to dominate that category with 


Interview's Question: What benefits do you get from thinking of something (tech, etc.) as a medium rather than a tool?
Alan's kay Answer: The way I thought about this in the 60s was that one way to define a tool is as something that helps control some of the degrees of freedom in a medium while allowing concentration on selected others.

For example, “paper” can be thought of as a medium (l


Interview's Question: What is the significance of late binding?
Alan's kay Answer: “Late-binding” is an idea about having desired functionality while retaining as much flexibility and safety as possible.

A big one to consider is that “software” itself is a late-binding of how a computer will behave. (Seems to be a pretty good idea, I’d


Interview's Question: What needs to be done in order to improve Anki to reach the promise of the Dynabook's "teacher for every learner"?
Alan's kay Answer: There’s definitely a way to think of learning as ultimately being able to remember — and every culture has found a lot of things that need to be remembered, are able to get children to eventually remember them, and have some of their behaviors be in accor


Interview's Question: How do I lay out my software architecture before I code if the requirements change every day?
Alan's kay Answer: Here’s an exemplary process from the past that is a good start on how to think about the present, and even more importantly about the future.

A change in federal laws in the mid-80s rendered much of public utility Brooklyn Union Gas’s database and report


Interview's Question: If a robot can achieve independent evolving thinking like a human being, shall we treat them like a human being instead of a machine?
Alan's kay Answer: An interesting dimension and question is “rights and standing”.

Robert Heinlein took up this question in the larger sense in his 1947 short story “Jerry Was A Man” (available online, perhaps not quite legally, at Jerry Was A Man).

Worth reading — as are


Interview's Question: Is software engineering culture based on traditional engineering culture?
Alan's kay Answer: My perception is that there are so many flavors of “Software Engineering” today — including many that claim “SE is what we do by definition” — that I can’t answer this question in general. And there is certainly a wide range of approaches that is apparent


Interview's Question: What part of Burroughs Systems did you work on? Did you enjoy it? What did you enjoy most, and why?
Alan's kay Answer: I wrote quite a few programs for the Burroughs 220 — a vacuum tube core memory computer of the late 50s — while in the US Air Force in the early 60s. This machine was a bit like the MIX machine that Don Knuth used for his “Art Of Programming” books (Don w


Interview's Question: Did ARPA/PARC preemptively try to measure the impact of its research projects?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m not sure I understand the question, but as far as I know, the answer is “no”.

There were sometimes “thresholds” that were agreed to in advance by researchers.

For example, at Parc, Butler Lampson urged at the founding of Parc, and we wound up agreei


Interview's Question: What is it like to be an Apple Fellow?
Alan's kay Answer: This was a point in time between 1984 and 1996, so I can’t speak for earlier or later.

The history of Fellow programs goes back to the President of MIT — Jerome Wiesner — wanting to do something for his “odd duck” genius faculty members who were a bit we


Interview's Question: How might drawing input work on a Dynabook?
Alan's kay Answer: Here’s the original cartoon and cardboard model from 1968.


You can see that one of the features is a stylus (modeled after the original RAND tablet stylus, and also the stylus and tablet we did for the Flex Machine).

In the 1972 paper I wrote for the A


Interview's Question: What are some software architecture mistakes where things were done at the wrong layer or level of abstraction?
Alan's kay Answer: If you knew there was going to be an Internet with many different kinds of computers, “operating systems” etc., and you realize that software “wants to run everywhere”, could you then imagine that traditional theories of “operating systems” and “programmi


Interview's Question: Was the Plato IV system any influence on the Alto and PARC in general?
Alan's kay Answer: I thought I had answered this a few years ago, but can’t find it.

In 1968, ARPA convened its first grad students conference at the U of Illinois, with two students selected from each ARPA project. John Warnock and I were the two from the Utah project. Jo


Interview's Question: What is the best way to learn Lisp in 2020?
Alan's kay Answer: Much of learning language today is “learning libraries”, but what’s really important about Lisp is its approach to computation, representing computations, and meta-reflection.

(Lisp is just the tiniest of universal kernels plus a “library” — so the learn


Interview's Question: Can we use object-oriented methodology for designing heterogeneous complex systems systems?
Alan's kay Answer: Here is my answer to what is essentially the same question: Software systems are becoming more complex & highly heterogeneous therefor they require better modeling approaches &implementation using multiple programming languages & technologies.can we use O


Interview's Question: I read somewhere that object-oriented programming was coined by Alan Kay circa 1966 or 1967 while he was at grad school. Has anyone influenced/contributed Alan to coin such a term?
Alan's kay Answer: Since the question has been asked, it’s worth reading the detailed history I was asked to write by the ACM in 1992, that became one of the sections of the 2nd History Of Programming Languages conference. The Early History Of Smalltalk

In brief for here, 


Interview's Question: Software systems are becoming more complex & highly heterogeneous therefor they require better modeling approaches &implementation using multiple programming languages & technologies.can we use OO methodology for designing such heterogeneous systems?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ll rewrite this question:

What we want to do with software is generally more complex than the combination of our tools and understanding can handle reasonably: what should we do?

We need to think about the best forms for decent solutions, and the best


Interview's Question: How important was William English to the evolution of the personal computer?
Alan's kay Answer: Bill English was one of my oldest friends and colleagues, and the simple answer is “enormously important”.

Interview's Question: Can you list and explain five (5) ways of interacting with the computer?
Alan's kay Answer: This question sounds like a homework assignment. If so, you could learn quite a bit by trying to answer it by poking around yourself. And, ditto, if it isn’t a homework assignment.


Interview's Question: Why do good ideas often not scale?
Alan's kay Answer: This was a favorite utterance of the great systems (both hardware and software) designer Bob Barton. His exact quote was:

“Good ideas don’t often scale”

It was both a cautionary heuristic and a practical observation.

For example, anyone can make a dogh


Interview's Question: In a talk Alan Kay gave, he said there are several reasons (6 or 7 reasons) why America no longer hires and makes a good use of its smart people and scientists like it used to in WW II and in The Cold War, can he mention them?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t think things are as total as the question implies. But — with regard to funding for computing as an example — I don’t think there is any question that the government funding for “edge” computer science is very far from the same quality and kind as


Interview's Question: What was the very first computer science fact you learned that blew your mind?
Alan's kay Answer: My undergrad majors (in the early 60s) were pure math and molecular biology, and I worked my way through college as a “data systems” programmer for the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo (basically writing sorting and retrieval rout


Interview's Question: Has the fixed architecture of microprocessors turned out to be a wrong turning, given that many functions can be more easily performed in a programmable gate array which are rather more flexible?
Alan's kay Answer: This question preaches to this particular choir, because of the great success at Xerox Parc in the 70s of the various microcoded personal computers done there. And before this, microcode (invented by Maurice Wilkes of EDSAC fame) had also been used in sig


Interview's Question: If threads were allowed to share the stack memory, what complications will this create? Please make a list and discuss it.
Alan's kay Answer: This sounds like a homework assignment, and — if so — I don’t think you should try to get Quorans to do the work for you.


Interview's Question: Are there any university math departments headed by a computer scientist?
Alan's kay Answer: Good question (and I don’t know offhand). But there are any number of computer scientists who are deep enough mathematicians to qualify (e.g. Don Knuth, etc).


Interview's Question: Why is it hard to make software compatible for multiple operating systems?
Alan's kay Answer: It actually isn’t very hard if you are willing to put in some extra work and care (and these extras could be considered “hard”, but they are up front prep).

A classic route was to make a virtual machine that is hardware independent by using an implementa


Interview's Question: What did Jon Von Neumann contribute to computers in contrast to Alan Turing?
Alan's kay Answer: Alan Turing in the mid 30s explored computability*, which was triggered by interest in Goedel’s demonstration that most interesting systems of logic were not completely decidable.

Turing did this by inventing a thought experiment that could do the simple

Interview's Question: Why do people often attribute inventions with only a single genius?
Alan's kay Answer: Joseph Campbell’s book “The Hero With A Thousand Faces” provides part of an answer. In this view, humans are not only genetically wired for language and stories, but we might even have some story tropes partly built in. In any case, cultures can preserve 


Interview's Question: What term describes an instance of a program being executed?
Alan's kay Answer: In antediluvian times it was called a “process”. I think terms have gotten mixed together and less clear these days …


Interview's Question: Which book has provided you the most tangible benefits in your life as a computer scientist?
Alan's kay Answer: Most of the writings that got me going early on (starting early in the 60s) were papers.

People who read a lot can never come up with “a single book” for anything.

I’ll just stick to the 60s. Books whose ideas and perspectives had a huge influence on me


Interview's Question: Are there necessary compromises between making a computer a consumer convenience along with being a tool for augmenting intellect?
Alan's kay Answer: One way for you to answer your question is to consider the technologies of reading/writing and their extension into the mass world via printing. If you start with the larger world of “augmenting intellect” via reading and writing and printing, it is very 


Interview's Question: How did people at PARC think about AI?
Alan's kay Answer: A short answer here, and I’ll likely get back to this for a longer one.

Interview's Question: How was the first computer system programmed before the advent of programming?
Alan's kay Answer: There are two ideas here (a) “program” and (b) “computer”.

Programs have been around for a long time as directions to be read and carried out (early on just by humans). Heron of Alexandria (ca 30 AD) made a variety of mechanical devices that were control


Interview's Question: Is there a programming language that uses past and future tense?
Alan's kay Answer: Some very confident (why?) answers here about “no, there aren’t programming languages with past tense”. Or “there isn’t any reason for such a thing”.

But take a look at Lucid, by Wadge and Ashcroft. Its variables are histories of the values, so the vario


Interview's Question: What did you think of How Did We Find Out About Computers by Isaac Asimov?
Alan's kay Answer: I like Asimov, but this book doesn’t explain anything that would help a child learn how computers work — how to make them, program them, get them to do a few semi-intelligent things, etc.


Interview's Question: What is the story behind Alan Kay’s adage “Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible”?
Alan's kay Answer: I think I came up with this slogan at Parc during discussions wrt children, end-users, user-interfaces, and programming languages. Chuck Thacker (the genius behind the Parc hardware) also liked it and adopted it as a principle for many of his projects.

Alan's kay Answer: For me, this question is out of the scope of a Quora answer.

I’m a full time researcher, but also an adjunct professor of “CS” at UCLA (which means I don’t have to go to faculty meetings, I can teach a class when I want to meet some students, and I can c


Interview's Question: Is the second best way to predict the future to fund it?
Alan's kay Answer: Note that the *easiest* way to predict the future is to *prevent* it. Or do nothing. Then the future will be like the present and the past (as it was for hundreds of thousands of years after humans appeared on the planet).

And that the phrase “the best w


Interview's Question: I saw the first half of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but it was annoyingly slow paced, and I didn't see the need for that "Dawn of Man" sequence. Is it worth watching the rest of the movie?
Alan's kay Answer: In Business, “the customer is always right” (this is why we buy/pay) — a large part of the process is to “find a desire and fill it”.

In Education “the learner is usually wrong” (this is why we learn) — a large part of the process is to help the students


Interview's Question: What aspects of Lisp influenced Smalltalk?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ve written about this variously elsewhere: including in “The Early History of Smalltalk”, and I’ve emphasized especially that “the idea of Lisp” pervades the underpinnings of Smalltalk as it was developed at Xerox Parc.

For me, it was spending a Sunday


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think of the proposed 50th anniversary celebration of Smalltalk in 2022?
Alan's kay Answer: I think especially celebrating Dan Ingalls would be a key point in a 50th anniversary celebration (if it weren’t for him, the various Smalltalks developed at Parc would not have happened).


Secondarily, I would celebrate Chuck Thacker, as the main design


Interview's Question: Why did almost no one in the US know about Charles Babbage in the 1930s, as mentioned in the book The Dream Machine?
Alan's kay Answer: Alexis de Tocqueville wrote about Americans in the 1840s: “They have no past and no future, but live in an extended present”.

I think it’s quite fair to say about most Americans that History of almost any kind is very far from their main interests or pas


Interview's Question: Are modes a feature or a bug in interface design?
Alan's kay Answer: Quite a bit of early user interface design was done by the ARPA community starting in the early 60s — as an outgrowth of JCR Licklider’s vision: “It is the destiny of computers to become interactive intellectual amplifiers for all humanity pervasively net


Interview's Question: Are there problems where a solution by symbolic computation (using only computer algebra regardless of difficulty or time required to solve them) is absolutely impossible that can only be solved with numerical methods? What are some examples?
Alan's kay Answer: Many non-linear problems don’t have algebraic solutions, and numerical methods have been used starting long before computing machinery to help. For example, most orbital mechanics, perturbation problems, fluid dynamics, etc.


Interview's Question: What are the most important elements of computing history not widely known by current CS graduates or working developers?
Alan's kay Answer: I think this question is much too large for a Quora sized answer (in part because of a combination of a lack of curiosity in the field generally, and a general lack of emphasis on history in schooling).

Just to pick four here in no special order — and fr


Interview's Question: Is our capacity for problem solving limited by abstraction? (Particularly in Computer Science)
Alan's kay Answer: Marvin Minsky liked to say “You can’t teach calculus to a cat”. So, sure, it is extremely likely that there are problems (and solutions) we can’t understand or even see.

On the other hand, we already use what Jerome Bruner called “Goedelization” to great


Interview's Question: How do I make an AI program that learns?
Alan's kay Answer: Here is a very simple but comprehensive example. You can see what is actually going on in the learning process for “conditioned learning”, and you can deeply learn how it works by making it. How would one explain AI to a complete beginner?


Interview's Question: Who developed idea of using vacuum tubes in computers?
Alan's kay Answer: Take a look at the legendary Tommy Flowers, who was one of the earliest to make computing machines using vacuum tubes.Tommy Flowers - Wikipedia

(Prepend). It’s worth saying a few words about what came before. The “logic of true and false” was written abo


Interview's Question: How do programming language designers manage language complexity?
Alan's kay Answer: A specific rather than general answer. For Smalltalk at Xerox Parc in the 70s, the approach was very Lisp-like: create a universal building block, implement that, and then deal with the complexities of designing and making “useful features” i.e. everythin


Interview's Question: How were computer programs and languages like COBOL installed into computers back in the 50s before software?
Alan's kay Answer: There was always “software” for “programmable computers” because this was the reason such computers were made (my favorite “first” is Maurice Wilkes’ EDSAC in 1948 (the Manchester people would quibble a bit).

There would usually be a “bootstrap” sequence


Interview's Question: Was computing dumbed down by the arrival of computer science in academia?
Alan's kay Answer: This is an interesting question! My first reaction was “absolutely not, just the opposite” … but this is the old fogey from the 60s reaction. This is because — pound for pound — by far the best “real computer science” * in the 60s was being done in the ma


Interview's Question: Does the Chinese Room prove that true artificial intelligence will never be developed?
Alan's kay Answer: A less misleading situation is to ask whether there is something not “mechanical” — or something “intrinsically intelligent” — about atoms that accumulates into “intelligence” and “consciousness” when the atoms are formed into a human brain.

A little mor


Interview's Question: What is an interesting and usual historical computer architecture? Was it definitely a dead-end or could it possibly make a come-back?
Alan's kay Answer: A really interesting “early architecture of great interest” was Wes Clark’s TX-2, the test computer at Lincoln Labs for the SAGE air defense system. This was also the machine that Ivan Sutherland used to invent a superset of modern computer graphics in 19


Interview's Question: Is computer program portability more important in today's mobile technology?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ve always thought it was tremendously important in every era that I’ve been in computing. “Software wants to run on everything” — a huge percentage of computer people seem to bend over backwards to prevent this, but I think it’s a mistake.


Interview's Question: Is it possible to program a word-processor or text-editor? How would I go about doing this?
Alan's kay Answer: Do you mean to make one from scratch? (They all have been made from scratch originally — more can be made).

Do you mean to have a programmable word processor? (E.g. Emacs is a famous one, Microsoft Word used to be programmable — I don’t know if it still 


Interview's Question: What thought process would lead one to invent object-oriented programming?
Alan's kay Answer: (Per Paul Hudson: “Maybe Alan Kay would answer. Since he did!”)

Well, OK.

In 1992, I was asked to write a history of what I actually did by the ACM for their second “History Of Programming Languages” conference. There are several versions online, includ


Interview's Question: How do you see Linus' prediction failure of parallel computing?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m not sure that he is predicting the failure of parallel computing. The context of the remarks seems tiny, and seems even limited to specific tiny contexts (for example using “locks” at all is a very bad way to try to deal with race conditions, etc.).




Interview's Question: Which are the earliest real-time text editors?
Alan's kay Answer: It would be great to track down a precision answer to this.

There were very early text editors in the 50s using various flexowriters, teletypes, and modified IBM electric typewriters.

On Whirldwind I, the Laning and Zwerler “George” interactive programm


Interview's Question: What bottlenecks need to be addressed in order for the real computer revolution to happen?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t think there is “one” real computer revolution, but the general premise that “it” or “these” haven’t happened yet does help pondering (and I also think that where things generally are today is so low compared to what could be done makes the phrase 


Interview's Question: If all knowledge of programming and computer science was to be gone, what 10 books/papers could restart the field and bring things back or make things better?
Alan's kay Answer: This question could be about a cold start to computing — no computers around at all — or it could be about “the computers and networks we now have are around, but no one knows how to program them”. Or something somewhere in between.

This makes a differen


Interview's Question: How many programmers were in the world in 1964?
Alan's kay Answer: It would be great to find definitive answers. I just sent an email to Fred Brooks to get his opinion.

However, it is safe to say — for 1964 — thousands at least, and most likely 10s of 1000s.

This is partly because of where IBM had gotten to by 1964: th


Interview's Question: How could computers develop their own language and take over the Earth?
Alan's kay Answer: Frederic Brown was a terrific science fiction writer in the 40s and 50s. He also loved to write “half-pagers”: entire sci-fi stories in a few hundred words. Here’s a favorite one from 1950:

Dwan Ev ceremoniously soldered the final connection with gold. T


Interview's Question: How do I reason that the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) does not violate the spirit of the Open Closed Principle (OCP)?
Alan's kay Answer: In theory, I don’t like this question, but in practice, I do.

But first a quote from Poincare: “Physicists talk about Physics, Sociologists talk about *methods*”.

He is trying to point out the real and large differences between a deeply developed field,


Interview's Question: Why is VSCode nearly 300 megabytes while Sublime Text is just 16 megabytes?
Alan's kay Answer: “Ouch!” on both the 300MB and the “just 16” … yikes!


Interview's Question: What are some good examples of liberal arts points of view brought to computing?
Alan's kay Answer: “Liberal arts points of view”?

Although I went to an “engineering” high school (“Brooklyn Technical HS”), I should have gone to “Bronx HS of Science” or “The High School of Music and Art”: the matchups are partly a matter of temperament. However, one of 


Interview's Question: What is the relationship between performance and abstraction?
Alan's kay Answer: This question needs more to it. For example, does the “abstraction” contain requirements for certain levels of performance? (as we’d expect if the abstraction is a “runnable requirements” language). If the result meets the requirements, then the relations


Interview's Question: How did drawing work on the Alto?
Alan's kay Answer: Parc started up in 1970–1, coincidentally with the advent of the first VLSI chips: the 1103 dynamic RAM from Intel (all of 1024 bits, but in a much: smaller package, lower voltage, and lower cost than core memory). For the first time, just a few people co


Interview's Question: To what extent did Simula influence Smalltalk?
Alan's kay Answer: To a large extent. Basically: Simula cannot be praised too highly — and along many dimensions.

I was asked to write a comprehensive history of Smalltalk for the ACM’s “History of Programming Languages” — called “The Early History Of Smalltalk”. This can 


Interview's Question: What was the historical significance of FORTRAN?
Alan's kay Answer: The historical significance of FORTRAN is primarily due to the level of software engineering in the system, but there was also a “four minute mile” effect from the combination of “early” and “efficient”.

An earlier significant system along the lines of “


Interview's Question: What are your favorite analogies to explain programming?
Alan's kay Answer: I have sometimes used “creating a banquet” or “organizing a restaurant”.

The “following a recipe” analogy is included as a tiny part of the larger processes, but it doesn’t capture many of the important parts of programming, which involves design, organi


Interview's Question: Is it possible to learn two programming frameworks at the same time?
Alan's kay Answer: In that galaxy long ago and far away (the 50s and early 60s) there were no standard operating systems, and most programming was done in assemblers that were symbolic representations of the underlying machine codes. And many “shops” had several computers o


Interview's Question: Why do musical artists - even the best ones - lose their ability to write a memorable new melody, far before they lose the ability to sing or play?
Alan's kay Answer: For the same reason that it is much easier to read one’s own language than to write in it — especially to write beautifully.


Interview's Question: Could the piano have more than 88 keys?
Alan's kay Answer: Take a look at the Boesendorfer Imperial Grand. It has 9 extra keys in the bass that extend the compass down to a low C (so 97 keys).


Even more important is that Boesendorfers are wonderfully sounding instruments, with a very creamy french horns to flut


Interview's Question: How many of ARPA/PARC’s researchers were married while they did their breakthrough work?
Alan's kay Answer: With regard to the computer researchers there, I’d say “quite a few” (I don’t know how to be more precise). And I would guess that the physical sciences researchers were even more so.


Interview's Question: Can you explain AI to a novice?
Alan's kay Answer: Many single-celled microorganisms are able to detect toxic conditions — temperature, acidity, etc. — and initiate a “tumbling” behavior that finds random directions that can move them away from the danger. Similarly, many can detect when “things are good”


Interview's Question: What did you think of the work being done at General Magic?
Alan's kay Answer: I was “in the conversation” (along with John Sculley, etc.) when this project and then company was set up. Basically, the idea was to make a hand-held device that would embody something like the next levels of HyperCard as a cradle for many kinds of servi


Interview's Question: Why was Alan Kay's Smalltalk in the Xerox Alto sufficiently efficient for a desktop GUI in 1979 but it isn't sufficient today?
Alan's kay Answer: The two answers by Eliot Miranda and Mark Miller are very good, so there is little to add here. But I should say a few words about the general Parc approach to HW architectures (and more can be found in other answers I’ve given).

First, though, is to com


Interview's Question: Why are we born into sin?
Alan's kay Answer: Here’s an attempt at a non-religious answer.

We humans have many paradoxes that we deal with quite unevenly. For example, genetically we have urges to cooperate — we would not be social animals if we didn’t — and also to compete. We desire to be in a gro


Interview's Question: Why do Fender guitars have different headstocks than other guitars?
Alan's kay Answer: Just to introduce the concept that there were things happening before the near present … i.e. in the past. One of the first guitars to use an inline headstock was the Fabricatore ca 1806. The idea was used in many guitars by the top German builder of earl


Interview's Question: Which programming language is best for developing a website that can scale to over 100 million users?
Alan's kay Answer: By the end of 2020 it is estimated that there will be about 50 billion computers connected via the Internet. How to invent such an architecture—and one that never has to be shut down for fixing and growing— was worked out by the ARPA-Parc research communi


Interview's Question: What were the biggest mistakes made by Xerox?
Alan's kay Answer: It’s worth noting that IBM had no idea about personal computing (they would never have farmed out the OS if they had taken it seriously), and didn’t know how to sustain their early success.

Nor did DEC.

Apple got the GUI, but not networking. And, Apple 


Interview's Question: What happened to Dan Ingall's Smalltalk interpreters?
Alan's kay Answer: I think quite a few of them are around and working in different forms. Dan has given talks showing live examples from almost all of the Smalltalks for which he was the main kernel force. Many of these talks are on YouTube.

Online, there are playable vers


Interview's Question: What parts of Englebart's Augment/ARC work are still missing from modern groupware, and why are they important?
Alan's kay Answer: A direct answer here would be much larger than “Quora sized”. This is because Doug Engelbart’s conceptions were qualitatively different than most of the much tinier ideas and visions of today’s developers.

The wonderful Bret Victor wrote the best obituar


Interview's Question: What's arguably the single most amazing thing that computers have made possible?
Alan's kay Answer: I think the answer to this is very like the answer to “what is the single most amazing thing that writing (and then the printing press) have made possible”.

It is not that writing and the press made possible a very different kind of travel through time a


Interview's Question: What is extensibility in object-oriented programming?
Alan's kay Answer: Programming languages have appearances (“syntax”), meanings (“semantics”), and efficiencies (“pragmatics”). A really good “extensible language” will allow each of these to be extended (and in large ways when this is a good idea).

It’s worth noting that t


Interview's Question: Why do you need to use command prompt?
Alan's kay Answer: There are a number of good end-user solutions using GUIs that lie between pure text command lines and highly graphical programming.

With respect to graphical programming, it’s important to note that Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad — my vote for the first rea


Interview's Question: Which books should I read to learn about the stories and anecdotes which lead us to the "modern" computer science?
Alan's kay Answer: I think the 20 or 30 books I have read about this are far less than half the books published about the history of computing. Most of the ones I have read are flimsy and inaccurate. The easy part of this for me to check was that the books that featured inc


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think of Dynamicland?
Alan's kay Answer: A terrific and beautiful world of ideas and experiences!


Interview's Question: How usable was composition between widgets in Smalltalk 80 on the Xerox Alto? Could full applications be developed this way?
Alan's kay Answer: The answers to each question are somewhat different. First, there weren’t really “applications” of the stove-piped variety people are used to today. Every object was encapsulated and could be a component of a system, and every object was viewable (and vie


Interview's Question: Why were computers like the DEC PDP-10 called minicomputers, since they weren't really that small?
Alan's kay Answer: The PDP-10 was a “mainframe computer” and was not called a minicomputer. The PDP-8 was called a minicomputer, as were most of the early PDP-11s.

One angle on the name, which to some extent correlated with physical size was the “word size” of the machine.


Interview's Question: How did humans discover how to make fire?
Alan's kay Answer: We don’t know.

Most of the answers that speculate that fire from natural causes was carefully preserved long before making it was discovered are almost certainly correct.

The American Indians did this in a number of ways, and the practice was continued 


Interview's Question: Is 60Hz not fast enough for a VR headset?
Alan's kay Answer: There are a number of human vision characteristics that need to be handled really well to make VR a good matchup.

(1) Foveal vs Peripheral acuity - most of the acuity of a human eye is in the small foveal region of about 2x3°. We are pretty much legally 


Interview's Question: Why do people say that Ada Lovelace was the first programmer, when Babbage wrote the first programs for his own machine?
Alan's kay Answer: Goethe said “We should all share in the excitement of discovery without vain attempts to claim priority”. He meant not just “early” but any time an important idea is realized by a human being.

The pop cultures — and to some extent the more developed cult


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think about Joe Armstrong claiming that "Erlang might be the only object-oriented language" and also his thesis supervisor’s claim that “Erlang is extremely object oriented”?
Alan's kay Answer: I love Joe Armstrong — we lost a great man when he recently left us.

And, he might be right. Erlang is much closer to the original ideas I had about “objects” and how to use them.

However, another way to look at this is to consider “What Is Actually Nee


Interview's Question: Who are the most influential people in the history of computing?
Alan's kay Answer: I think there are too many for a fair account in a Quora sized answer, especially if we give credit to insights regardless of whether they were followed up.

I think of “computing” as processes that help one deal with ideas. And this covers a lot of groun


Interview's Question: Is traditional engineering becoming a pop culture due to the modern practice of software development?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t know, and I suspect not in the way that computing has been going.

Much of traditional engineering is life threatening unless done carefully and scrupulously, and most engineers really take their calling seriously.

For example, I think that most 


Interview's Question: Is Archibald Putt a creation of Alan Kay?
Alan's kay Answer: Not this Alan Kay …


Interview's Question: What are Alan Kay's views on automation and technological unemployment?
Alan's kay Answer: I think the issues revolve around a society’s conception of itself, its main societal goals, and the tradeoffs between our genetic heritage, the traditional cultural views of “reality” and mores, and the more recent inventions that are more distinct from 


Interview's Question: How and why did Xerox fail to capitalise on PARC's inventions?
Alan's kay Answer: There are good enough answers under this Quora link (this is an example of a question that has already been asked and answered).

Why couldn't the management of Xerox see the goldmine that they had with inventions at Xerox PARC? Was it really about lackin


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think of the Tablon and similar portable practice devices (I carry mine with me almost everywhere)?
Alan's kay Answer: Hi Lawson

About 6 or 7 years ago my left thumb base joint gave up the ghost (arthritis, bone spurs, loss of cartilage, etc) and I had to give up guitar. About a year ago I heard a wonderful lute player — Thomas Dunford —

and was so taken with his playin


Interview's Question: How can I help develop a wiki-Pharo? (Many people using and editing the same Pharo environment image in real time.)
Alan's kay Answer: I suggest you not worry about Pharo — or any other programming environment — but do ponder scaling, “number of cooks”, dependency, and coordination issues.

One of the ways to do this is to look at complex structures, both in nature (Biology) and human-ma


Interview's Question: Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure has said that object-oriented programming is unable to model “time” properly. What does "modeling time" actually mean?
Alan's kay Answer: Most languages don’t model time — and worse, let the CPU determine what time means.

But the need for it, and a variety of solutions have been around for at least 60 years now.

Part of John McCarthy’s long ago insight (that after 60 years I wish computer


Interview's Question: How can I learn more about the original spirit of computing (as alluded to by Alan Kay, et al.)?
Alan's kay Answer: I take “the original spirit of computing” to mean “for the fun and the art of it”, and the “art” part meaning to create better works of art at all levels, especially the foundational levels.

If we take “computing” as “manipulating information to satisfy 


Interview's Question: Experienced programmers and computer scientists, what are some really old (or even nearly forgotten) books you think every new programmer should read?
Alan's kay Answer: I love that “2006” and “2008” (in another answer) must be considered “really old” (which is what the question requests) …

I’m still a big fan of the “Lisp 1.5 Programmers Manual” (MIT Press — still in print). This version of the language is no longer wit


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think about tension between sharing research methods and findings freely and early & preserving commercial viability so the findings can be made into products that change the world?
Alan's kay Answer: What do you think about the Internet? Etc.?

The question doesn’t really make sense as stated because sharing the best ideas freely creates the greatest opportunity for conversion into products, whether world changing or otherwise …

I.e. what “tension”?



Interview's Question: American computer pioneer Alan Kay’s concept, the Dynabook, was published in 1972. How come Steve Jobs and Apple iPad get the credit for tablet invention?
Alan's kay Answer: The Dynabook idea happened in 1968.


But the simple part of the idea — a personal computer on the back of a flat screen display with a stylus and touch sensitivity — is hard to consider a real invention given:

Flat-screen displays. I saw the first Unive


Interview's Question: Who first came with the concept of Computer Mouse, XEROX or Apple?
Alan's kay Answer: There was an early electrically sensed joystick in the 20s — partly invented for “remote-control airplanes”.

1926 Joystick Remote Control Circuit Patent

NRL’s C.B. Mirick patented his system for remote radio control of pilotless aircraft (or of “any cir


Interview's Question: In retrospect, what were some funny idiosyncrasies of older computers?
Alan's kay Answer: Besides crashing randomly?

One that was funny in retrospect came in 1965 when I and others from the “future CDC 6600 community” — Livermore Labs, Los Alamos, National Center for Atmospheric Research, etc. — were called to CDC’s Chippewa Falls labs to hel


Interview's Question: What did the early room sized super computers do? And how powerful are they relative to modern day computers?
Alan's kay Answer: We could look at the AN/FSQ-7 — known as the “Q7” — which was the main computing architecture for the SAGE air defense system in the 50s.

It was actually two very large computers — comparable with a football field — where:

the computational elements occ


Interview's Question: How important was Ada Lovelace for computer science?
Alan's kay Answer: This is a fascinating question about a “synthetic” or “artifactual” science (math is one of these also). This is a parallel to asking “how many times was the arch invented?”, and “for a particular arch e.g. in the Arc de Triomphe, would it have mattered i


Interview's Question: Were the compilers of the first programming languages written in machine code?
Alan's kay Answer: I wonder if “machine code” here means “in on-or-off-bits” or “assembler”? And whether “programming languages” includes “assembler”?

In the case of a really bare machine with no reasonable way of using another computer to help, programmers would still wri


Interview's Question: Who created the computer?
Alan's kay Answer: There have been similar questions on Quora, and I’ve given a variety of answers. (Which I’ll try to find and reference here (would be really usable if Quora used that strange invention of “windows” to allow this kind of perusal on this page while writing 


Interview's Question: Why were computer monitors not rectangular to begin with?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m not sure I understand this question. Do you mean “as opposed to being circular” or “as opposed to being square”? If you clarify your question I might be able to answer.

In brief, many of the earliest computer displays were made from Cathode Ray Tubes


Interview's Question: What is your hobby that has the best bang for the buck in happiness per dollar?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ve never thought about hobbies in terms of cost — they are all about passion and “work/play” for the sheer fun of it. And my main ones are about “life itself” and non-optional. So the “happiness” part from these is enormously high.

I don’t know how to 


Interview's Question: What is the oldest or most unique computer you have ever used?
Alan's kay Answer: The “oldest” -or- “most unique” computer I’ve ever used? Let’s take “programmable digital computer” to simplify away from various kinds of analog computers and the abacus, and “written a program for” instead of “used”.

The “oldest” has two candidates (a)


Interview's Question: What was the last breakthrough in computer programming?
Alan's kay Answer: There are lots of dimensions to “computer programming” and “programming languages”, so simple sorting won’t be satisfactory. But there is also a dilemma — I think — in that “something happened” in the 80s to what were major improvements every 11 years or 


Interview's Question: When Alan Kay talks about the size of the SAGE and the TX-2 computer, he uses the terms like "the size of the football field" and "the size of a building", what does it exactly mean?
Alan's kay Answer: Here’s an example of a SAGE four story concrete “blockhouse” with “power supply” in the first floor, the two large Q-7 vacuum tube computers on the second floor — they ran in tandem as one system, the “situation rooms” with enormous display projection equ


Interview's Question: What is it like to work at Disney as a programmer?
Alan's kay Answer: I wasn’t a programmer there for the five years I spent at Disney — but the company had invited me to bring my research group to be part of Walt Disney Imagineering, and — partly because I knew and admired some of the old time Imagineers — we wound up maki


Interview's Question: Why is the guitar "easy to learn but difficult to master"?
Alan's kay Answer: The “difficult to master” part is common to all music because people who are deeply involved with music don’t just make it, they explore it, extend it, invent and reinvent it. Like sports, this pushes the boundaries towards human limits to the extent that


Interview's Question: What will Silicon Valley do once it runs out of Doug Engelbart's ideas?
Alan's kay Answer: I’d like to see.

However, we are in no danger at present. Silicon Valley has more or less ignored or abandoned many of Doug’s best ideas, so they are still around to be rediscovered and put forth.

Right now we are also not in any close prospect to seein


Interview's Question: Which is the best book for teaching programming to kids (11 to 16 years)?
Alan's kay Answer: The “best book” right now might not be good enough. I don’t know of a “really good” book for teaching programming to 11–16 years of age, but there might be one — I’d love to see what other Quorans think are good books.

A deep question here is “plasticity


Interview's Question: What’s the difference between applicative, recursive, and imperative programming?
Alan's kay Answer: Programming is providing a mechanism with what’s needed to achieve a goal we have.

Sometimes the mechanism can be dealt with very directly. Sometimes things will work out better if we first get the mechanism to act like a more convenient mechanism that w


Interview's Question: Shouldn’t object-oriented “design” be studied before object-oriented “programming”? I’m sick and tired of these useless toy examples in these programming books. Why shouldn’t we learn to design first and then implement?
Alan's kay Answer: I like Marvin Minsky’s solution to the problem of teaching programming (in this case teaching Lisp to grad students in the 60s). He would give them the previous year’s PhD theses and ask them to find how the thesis did something, and then make a change to


Interview's Question: Does Alan Kay think about how research into human biology and medicine is conducted?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m not at all sure about the center of this question. Perhaps the questioner can clarify in a comment …. ?

At least at a shallow level, I would say “yes, I do”. However, I’m sure biologists consider me “lapsed” at this point (I certainly do, though I tr


Interview's Question: What lessons were learned in aspiring towards the DynaBook, and have any of its original goals become dated?
Alan's kay Answer: A big subject over many years (the Dynabook idea was formed and fleshed out starting in 1968 with a cartoon I drew and a cardboard model I made — so more than 50 years ago now). The first public paper I wrote about this was in 1972.


The large idea that 


Interview's Question: Will technological advancement continue as quickly as it has from the 2000s to now?
Alan's kay Answer: The keyword here is “advancement”. I think of the most important use of this in phrases such as “advancing the human condition”, etc.

If we take the trouble to try to understand our own species — via anthropology and its spinoffs — then we can see that q


Interview's Question: What can I do to develop my explaining skills?
Alan's kay Answer: Answering Quora questions for which you are willing to do the necessary work is great practice.


Interview's Question: Has a robot ever smoked?

Interview's Question: What do some not understand or know about the difference between an amateur and a professional? Has this ever affected you personally?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ve never liked these terms (and have been guilty of using them myself).

The two main definitions of “amateur” are “not paid” and “not good”. “Professional” means “paid” and generally connotes “good”.

But the French word from which the English term is 


Interview's Question: How do I modulate from E major to B flat major?
Alan's kay Answer: Lots of ways — let’s see if we can get answerers to contribute some of their ideas.

I take “modulate” here to mean winding up in the key of Bb major and feeling that as a key center (as opposed to just getting deftly to the Bb major chord).

It’s worth t


Interview's Question: How was the Xerox Alto done in only 3 months?
Alan's kay Answer: Basically: Chuck Thacker was simply amazing.

I recounted some of the history of the Alto in “The Early History of Smalltalk”, and both Butler Lampson and Chuck also wrote histories of that time that included accounts of the Alto development (all can be f


Interview's Question: In object-oriented programming, why is it bad practice to make data members public when the get() & set() public members modify it anyway?
Alan's kay Answer: If you use setters, you are not really working with objects, but glorified data structures. This use of objects as “Abstract Data Types” is not in the spirit of Object Oriented Programming and Design. This misuse is one of the biggest misconceptions about


Interview's Question: Why are guitars tuned with an open B when a C seems more logical?
Alan's kay Answer: An interesting range of answers in the previous 9. It’s worth going back in time before the guitar to see how lutes, vihuelas, gambas, etc were tuned.

Ans: all in 4ths except for one major 3rd somewhere — and as noted in some of the other answers: 4ths b


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think of using either Squeak or Pharo as the first language for introducing programming?
Alan's kay Answer: Helping someone learn something is a deep UI situation, and it has to start with the first word in UI.

I think of the process as being quite similar to teaching a musical instrument (which I used to do), and the best thing one can do in the very beginnin


Interview's Question: If you worked on pre-Unix time sharing systems such as ITS, Multics, TOPS-10, Tenex, or others, can you describe some of your experiences?
Alan's kay Answer: By accident, I entered the U of Utah Computer Science grad school in 1966, and found that it was one of the “ARPA Research Universities” (I had never heard of ARPA, etc).

Dave Evans had set up the department the year before when he moved back to Utah fro


Interview's Question: As a computer scientist, how much math do you actually use?
Alan's kay Answer: Mathematics is a plural because many ways to “represent ideas to allow reasoning about them” have been devised. That little “s” also implies that more can be invented as needed.

What this means is that sometimes one can use already devised “maths” to hel


Interview's Question: What is, in your opinion, the best textbook for self-studying computer architecture and programming “from the bottom up” (where the bottom is the logic gates level)?
Alan's kay Answer: This is a great question! And I’ve periodically wanted to know the answer over the years — especially when I’ve wanted to teach “a whole systems” course.

I’m in London for a few months more and away from my main library, so I can’t list the books I’ve fo


Interview's Question: Why aren't there any books about the history of modern computer programming (like 1970 onwards)? Most books seem to delve really far back and only just touch on the present and future of programming.
Alan's kay Answer: I take your question to imply “good books” (there are plenty of pop culture books about microcomputers onwards).

The best book about Parc is actually about the ARPA research community started by JCR Licklider — “The Dream Machine” by Mitchell Waldrop — t


Interview's Question: What is the nearest modern equivalent to Bell Labs or Xerox Parc?
Alan's kay Answer: I take the question as being mostly about “similar process” rather than particular topics of focus.

I haven’t found one that has the same feel. The two today that are worth looking at more closely are Janelia Labs and the Max Planck Institute. I know the


Interview's Question: Why does technology tend toward complexity?
Alan's kay Answer: In talks, I’ve made the distinction between “Complex” and “Complicated”, where “Complexity” is an intrinsic property of an organization of “ingredients” to satisfy a goal, and “Complication” is extrinsic — mostly due to human poor design, execution, etc. 


Interview's Question: Is there an OOP approach that uses a "milieu", not an object graph, to send messages, similar to how my voice is carried through the air and hits people who happen to be in range, rather than being addressed to a specific person?
Alan's kay Answer: A good early event-driven system was the “Sol” programming language by Knuth and McNeely (ca early 60s).

You can take a look at a number of locational “particles and fields” object programming ideas.

For example, suggested in my 1984 Scientific American


Interview's Question: Does Alan Kay see any new ideas in computing?
Alan's kay Answer: “New” is not what I look for. “Ideas that make a qualitative difference over past techniques” are what I’d like to see.

Years ago, I’m fairly sure I was aware of pretty much everything regarding computing that was going on in the world. Today, I’m defini


Interview's Question: Are shallow inheritance hierarchies better?
Alan's kay Answer: In English we often say “This is like that except …” and most of the time this is a plus if there is a good mapping between the two ideas and the “except” doesn’t destroy the mapping. In inheritance we are in theory saying something safer: “This comes fro


Interview's Question: What are your thoughts on the free software movement?
Alan's kay Answer: I think it’s very similar to “free speech”. It’s important to allow, but the equivalents of yelling “fire” in a theater should be curtailed.

Another facet of this these days includes what you can do with biology on a kitchen table with about $10K-$20K wo


Interview's Question: What makes for a great software demo?
Alan's kay Answer: Presentations are “theater”, and always about the audience.

The vast majority of human beings are “instrumental reasoners” (meaning that they mostly judge on how an idea or tool contributes to their current goals). Only a small percentage will be interes


Interview's Question: Does Sequoia Capital have enough cash from its investments to create a modern day Xerox PARC?
Alan's kay Answer: The old Don Valentine company that funded Atari, Apple, and many others …

The computer part of Xerox Parc was relatively small — Butler Lampson has estimated that the many major inventions were done by about 25 computer scientists (and this would imply a


Interview's Question: Did early computing necessarily have to be in binary, or could there have been another completely different concept that would have evolved into the technology we enjoy today?
Alan's kay Answer: Babbage’s “Mill” (the CPU of his engines) — along with other arithmetical computers before and after — used gears, and worked in base 10. These schemes were “digital” — meaning they represented discrete values. Since the gears turned, the apparatus was “a


Interview's Question: How do you tune the 1st string of the guitar without a tuner?
Alan's kay Answer: An old trick, which may not work so well today, was to use a fluorescent light* as a reference.

They used to emit a nice 60Hz hum (actually one or two octaves above this depending on the fixture), and this is just slightly sharper than a Bb (the Bb is a 


Interview's Question: Is computer science distinct from the liberal arts?
Alan's kay Answer: Let’s first collect a few opinions on what constitutes “liberal arts”.

Wikipedia says:

Liberal arts education (from Latin liberalis "free" and ars "art or principled practice") can claim to be the oldest programme of higher education in Western history.


Interview's Question: What would Alan Kay suggest is the ideal way for somebody to start learning about computing at a corporate level?
Alan's kay Answer: After procrastinating for years I finally seriously took up classical pipe organ at age 40 while Chief Scientist at Atari and then a Fellow at Apple Computer. As with most people of that age, I was already quite busy.

Learning the pipe organ — is 2+ hour


Interview's Question: What classes did Alan Kay teach at New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program, UCLA, Kyoto University, and MIT?
Alan's kay Answer: An elliptical answer in two stories …

In the Fall of 1966, via quite accidentally winding up as “grad student #7” at the U of Utah computing grad school — after undergrad in math and biology and working my way through college as a programmer at the Natio


Interview's Question: What are the Seven Wonders of computer science?
Alan's kay Answer: I love this question — in no small part because I don’t think a really correct/exclusive answer is possible.

I have a particular set of meanings for the term “computer science” — the questioner might have meant to say “computing”. A few of my items might


Interview's Question: When is incremental progress good?
Alan's kay Answer: “Better and Perfect are the Enemies of ‘What Is Actually Needed’ ”.

If WIAN can be accomplished incrementally without changes in Type, then there are many advantages to this, including low risk and high integrity of results. (Basically you want engineers


Interview's Question: Does Y Combinator's "100 happy users" advice originate from Butler Lampson?
Alan's kay Answer: Eddie’s answer is “plausible”.

Butler did get us to agree to the “100 users” idea.

Eric Schmidt actually worked with Butler when he was at Parc, and certainly picked up the idea while there.

Eddie’s reference (4) seems diffuse on this point, especially


Interview's Question: If Alan Kay made an introductory technical course syllabus to teach real computer science to undergraduates, what would be on it?
Alan's kay Answer: I will add to and change this from time to time because there is not enough room in a Quora-sized answer to provide a good enough answer, nor enough time to really think things through as needed, but …

What if the intent here is “as a required course for


Interview's Question: Was the Xerox Alto a prototype or a finished product?
Alan's kay Answer: It was neither. It was a “time machine” to allow individual researchers starting in 1973 to work about 12–15 years in the future they were trying to invent rather than being forced to use and work around the hardware and software of the early 70s.

Anothe


Interview's Question: How do you understand that you don't understand the understanding demanded by a problem?
Alan's kay Answer: I always assume I don’t have the necessary understanding to start on anything (this is a good heuristic for we humans to insert before thought and actions of any kind).

One of the consequences of this is that because many “problems” are quite often not a


Interview's Question: What was computing like in the 1960’s?
Alan's kay Answer: I started computing ca 1961, and my job in the Air Force starting in 1962 was as a programmer for Air Training Command at Randolph AFB in San Antonio. I entered grad school at the University of Utah ARPA project in 1966.

With all due respect to Andrew Si


Interview's Question: How do I learn to think better?
Alan's kay Answer: To me, the first thing to notice about human thinking — via scrutinizing the rare examples of “first class thinking” we can identify — is that we humans are pretty much not genetically equipped for thinking at all!

We are most well set up for learning ho


Interview's Question: What made APL programming so revolutionary?
Alan's kay Answer: APL stands for “A Programming Language”, the title of the book in 1962 written by Ken Iverson about what initially was called “Iverson Notation”. Part of the reason for the “notation” label was that it was used extensively a number of years as “a notation


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think about inheritance in object-oriented programming?
Alan's kay Answer: Simula I didn’t have inheritance (paper ca 1966) and Simula 67 did (paper ca 1968 or so). I initially liked the idea — it could be useful — but soon realized that something that would be “mathematically binding” was really needed because the mechanism its


Interview's Question: Why did Alan Kay choose rectangular shaped Windowing as the initial style of GUI? What were the considerations and impracticality of differently shaped windowing approach?
Alan's kay Answer: The 4 answers already given are pretty good.

First, one of the earliest — if not the earliest — example of a windowed display with general clipping was that of Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad (ca 1962) which windowed a very large virtual display surface that


Interview's Question: If I want to improve my piano playing capabilities, are there any mathematical patterns I should be aware of?
Alan's kay Answer: John von Neumann said that mathematics is about “relationships about relationships”, and there are lots of these in most music: some of them are interesting, some even profound.

But I think there are important parallels between poetry and music with rega


Interview's Question: How did you lose the bad habits you gained from self-learning a musical instrument?
Alan's kay Answer: See the great answers by Ben Simmons and Ed Durbrow.

After playing many jazz gigs around NYC and Long Island, I wound up in the Air Force in Texas in the early 60s. I was not in a band there, but got myself a wonderful Gibson Johnny Smith guitar. I decid


Interview's Question: Among the best guitarists in the world, why aren't there any women?
Alan's kay Answer: There are lots of well known female “best guitarists in the world” in the classical guitar world, including with truly incredible chops of the kind valued in the popular and rock world.

But classical guitar is a very extensive art and passion — it is lot


Interview's Question: How can I improve my piano playing and learn to play faster sections? I can play them slower than proper temp but cannot seem to increase speed to 'tempo'.
Alan's kay Answer: Here’s where a little more info from you about where you are would be helpful.

Metronomes and gradual increases are generally helpful at any stage.

But there’s another aspect to fast playing, and that is the mental transfer from thinking about each note


Interview's Question: To what extent was it possible to build a digital computer during ancient Rome?
Alan's kay Answer: This is a very interesting question — right up there with one that I used to put to a class on computer design: “What computer would Captain Nemo have designed for the Nautilus? — Sketch out the design for this!”

The current question can be taken in a nu


Interview's Question: What is the most difficult concept to grasp in computer science?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m not sure what “computer science” means to the requester. Almost 15 years ago I had occasion to give talks at a number of universities, and at each one asked the audience of students and professors for their definition of the term. Overwhelmingly, the 


Interview's Question: In a chord sheet, what does the 2 chords with slash like Am/F# mean? Playing them together on a piano makes a dissonance.
Alan's kay Answer: It’s worth thinking about this chord a bit. As the other answers indicate, the slash followed by a name means play that note in the bass.

If you play the chord with normal Am spelling — A, C, E, F# — you can see that the F# is the “6th” position in the c


Interview's Question: What was the first computer you worked with, and in what language did you program it?
Alan's kay Answer: I answered part of this question in a related question: When you were learning assembly language, what assembly language did you study?

My first real computer was the IBM 1401 in 1962 in the Air Force. It was a “character-based computer” with 6-bit chara


Interview's Question: To what extent did the Xerox PARC Alto inspire the Apple Macintosh?
Alan's kay Answer: I wish it had beyond gross appearances. The bitmap display and mouse pointing device were the most obvious inspirations.


The Alto was intended to amplify a wide range of users.

Some of the software on Alto — such as Smalltalk with its overlapping windo


Interview's Question: Is there static typing for a Smalltalk derivative?
Alan's kay Answer: Besides looking at the past, we should look to the present and the future.

The basic idea of “object” is to invest a “full virtual computer” so it can provide useful services via messages in a machine independent way and with enough encapsulation to be s


Interview's Question: Which of your guitars would you keep if you had to give them all up, but one, for the rest of your life? Let’s assume you own multiple guitars (acoustic, electric, nylon, steel, 12-string, etc.)
Alan's kay Answer: Like J Robb Wilson, I also have a 1962 Gibson Johnny Smith that I got in 1962 while in the Air Force, and played it on jobs for many years. I kept it in mint condition. Hard to imagine parting with such a source of memories.


Gibson Johnny Smith (not min


Interview's Question: Did Xerox PARC write human interface guidelines?
Alan's kay Answer: Yes.

In the early days, we did many little test systems and many dozens of experiments, first on a special high-bandwidth and resolution “video generator” with a memory that could be used to store bit-map images (including for text characters). This expe


Interview's Question: What was the Whole Earth Catalog?
Alan's kay Answer: It was a series of wonderful collections of “access to tools” especially including “tools for thought” of hundreds of books worth reading (the first 500 books to go in the Xerox PARC library were *all* the books in the Whole Earth Catalog). Much of its ap


Interview's Question: What are the successors / continuations of the "talking typewriter" project/idea referred to by Alan Kay?
Alan's kay Answer: I was hoping someone would answer this so I could find out!

The question references a paper I wrote in 1972. About 5 years ago I was asked to write an essay on “The Future Of Reading” in which I referenced both the original “talking typewriter” for child


Interview's Question: What did ARPA-IPTO / PARC learn about how to do good problem-finding?
Alan's kay Answer: Interesting Quora glitch (this question didn’t automatically get sent to me — I just found it randomly).

JCR Licklider (“Lick”) had a nose for large visions (you can experience his early reaction to interactive computing in his 1960 paper “Man-Computer S


Interview's Question: What is creativity?
Alan's kay Answer: Creativity is seeing wonderful things that most people can’t see.


Interview's Question: How did you learn to play the piano with both hands independently?
Alan's kay Answer: When I started playing keyboards as a kid I was exploring how chords and melodies went together, and the approach suggested to me was to learn “the three chords” as three note chords with minimal movement of the left hand, and see how these would work wit


Interview's Question: I can tune a guitar by ear without any reference notes. Does that mean I have perfect pitch?
Alan's kay Answer: “Perfect pitch” is actually “good pitch memory”.

We know this from (a) accounts of musicians in the past who could tell or sing pitches at will, (b) combined with the knowledge that the “standard pitch” in the past was different at different times.

For 


Interview's Question: What are your reflections on “The Mother of All Demos”?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ve been asked to give talks at the the 25th, the 30th, and the 40th anniversaries of the 1968 “MOAD”.

Here are the remarks I made 10 years ago at the 40th anniversary:

Recently, I’ve done two presentations for the 50th anniversary (a) on Dec 9th at th


Interview's Question: Musicians, how do you play your instruments for hours while staying entertained?
Alan's kay Answer: To a musician, music is life itself. “Entertainment” doesn’t come close to the “merging engagement” one has.

On reflection, the answer above didn’t take into account the range of “how life feels to different people”. So, trying again:

To a musician, pla


Interview's Question: Out of the inventions to come out of Xerox PARC, which were the most grossly caricatured by others and which were the most thoughtfully done?
Alan's kay Answer: Does “caricature” imply intent, or should we consider it just an observation of the result of sometimes blind processes?

It’s hard to caricature the laser printer, and in fact the rush to make lower cost low printing volume alternatives — e.g. Ink Jet — 


Interview's Question: Is "dark mode" (light text on a dark background) really better for the eyes?
Alan's kay Answer: Note: I only answered the original question. Some other agency changed the question without my permission, and my answer below doesn’t apply directly.

At Xerox Parc in the early 70s, the Alto’s video display could be used for either, so we did some tests


Interview's Question: Why does the American educational system seem to lack confidence in teaching higher-level mathematics in primary schools, where in many other countries, math is embraced instead of avoided?
Alan's kay Answer: “higher-level mathematics”? “in many other countries ‘math’ is embraced”?

I’m not sure what the italicized terms are supposed to mean here, especially with regard to children. Let’s go for the non-pop culture meaning for the first, and with Seymour Paper


Interview's Question: When you were learning assembly language, what assembly language did you study?
Alan's kay Answer: My first real machine for programming (and learning assembly coding) was the IBM 1401 in the US Air Force in 1962.

(After subsequently learning a few more machines, I realized that there were a wide variety of approaches to basic architecture. This becam


Interview's Question: What is the "proper" technique to play a classical guitar without fingernails (if there is one)?
Alan's kay Answer: Some pointers. First take a look at lute technique over many centuries, and you will find that most lute playing of all styles and eras was done without nails — the main exceptions were a few players, especially those who mainly played “continuo” (backgro


Interview's Question: Would you rather have three $1000 guitars with various characteristics (Strat/Tele/LP/semi-hollow, etc.) or one $3000 top-of-the-range guitar?
Alan's kay Answer: The question is sort of aimed at the electric (even rock) guitar world, but it might be useful for a perspective from the classical guitar side of things. An additional bit of context is that I have a “nice number” of very good electric guitars of various


Interview's Question: In the early days of the computer mouse, what were the arguments for and against making it one-button versus having multiple buttons?
Alan's kay Answer: The mouse was invented by Doug Engelbart and Bill English in 1964 for their proposed “oNLine System” (NLS). There were a number of other pointing devices around at that time, including the light-pen/”gun”, and several kinds of track balls. Invented the sa


Interview's Question: What guitar has the best tone?
Alan's kay Answer: Let’s leave “best” as subjective, and look at ranges of tone as played by you (or by some very accomplished player).

I want to discuss classical guitars, but first a Telecaster story. Some years ago, more or less by accident I picked up a Fender Telecast


Interview's Question: What’s a good introductory instrument to learn for someone who knows nothing about music?
Alan's kay Answer: Let me suggest “the voice”. This is because “musicality” has to be developed internally for any kind of musical production to be “musical”. If you take lessons on another instrument, at some point the teacher will try to get you to sing what you are tryin


Interview's Question: Recently I’ve been considering trading the first “real” guitar I ever bought myself for a stratocaster, I’ve loved the sound of strats for so long but I’m scared to give away my first guitar (its a telecaster) Should I trade it?
Alan's kay Answer: I’d would urge you to keep it (and make a plan for how to get a Strat). This is because “bonding” with an instrument is more than learning to use a tool — it becomes an extension of your psyche, imagination, even soul. You don’t want to amputate anything 


Interview's Question: What guitar surprised you the most (positively or negatively) when you first played it?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ve played lots of different guitars over the last 65 years, mostly electric — especially jazz guitars — and somewhat intermittently — with some long stretches professionally, gaps for grad school and research (I’m the kind of player who has to practice 


Interview's Question: Why are there frets on a guitar? Wouldn't a guitar player be able to play from hearing? They seem more annoying than useful to me.
Alan's kay Answer: I would like to drill deeper into the issues than the other answers.

Issue 1 - playing in tune at all

There’s the question of “what does it mean to play in tune on any instrument — especially where harmony is involved?” On instruments that are capable o


Interview's Question: How did the discipline of science spread after its invention?
Alan's kay Answer: A large question for a small space! On his landmark BBC/PBS show — “Civilization” — Kenneth Clark said: “People in the Middle Ages were as passionate about the Truth as we are, but their sense of evidence was very different”. The term “science” has meant 


Interview's Question: How would you tune a guitar to match a piano with stretched tuning? Would you tune to the lower bass notes being played or just the middle C?
Alan's kay Answer: Robert Preston’s answer is good. To understand what is going on, it’s worth contemplating why would tuners stretch the octaves (to make an interval sharper than a perfect octave) on a piano?

Seems like it would put the piano out of tune …

But it already


Interview's Question: Which is more difficult: playing piano or playing guitar?
Alan's kay Answer: The answers to this question are like a cross-section of US culture. The one I thought closest to useful was by Robert Micarelli.Roberto Micarelli's answer to Which is more difficult: playing piano or playing guitar?

Here is a different way to think abou


Interview's Question: Why hasn’t Alan Kay published a book?
Alan's kay Answer: Ouch!


Interview's Question: What book(s) would you recommend to a computer science student?
Alan's kay Answer: My basic answer is: read a lot outside of the computer field.

It is worth trying to understand what “science” means in “Computer Science” and what “engineering” means in “Software Engineering”.

“Science” in its modern sense means trying to reconcile phe


Interview's Question: 30 years ago, what were the first 5-10 steps in designing and creating a computer?
Alan's kay Answer: 30 years ago was 1988, and many components for many computers (especially personal computers) were VLSI, and could to some extent be TinkerToyed together.

But what if you had a special architecture in mind that would require considerable design at the ga


Interview's Question: Why was personal computing an unusual research choice in the 1960s?
Alan's kay Answer: I think Mark Miller’s answer is pretty good. One distinction that might help is that between “personal computing” and “personal computer”. The drive for interactive time-sharing of the large mainframe computers that started right around 1960 was a drive f


Interview's Question: Was anything meaningful lost for good when Xerox threw out their old PARC data disks?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t think that anything technical was lost. But from the standpoint of actual historical artifacts: certainly. As far as we know, the Smalltalk-78 image that we brought back to life a few years ago is the only extant version, and it was almost lost.




Interview's Question: Who is working on developing the Dynabook today?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t know specifically if anyone is working on the larger goals of the Dynabook. (When I first wrote this, I was as trapped in the physical design and the past, as anyone. So I missed pointing out that Bret Victor and his DynamicLand group have been wo


Interview's Question: What's the best Donald Trump joke you have heard?
Alan's kay Answer: Donald Trump!


Interview's Question: Isn't getting rid of the evil "state" like Haskell's approach, something every programmer should follow?
Alan's kay Answer: I wrote a Quora answer that touched on this question: Why is functional programming seen as the opposite of OOP rather than an addition to it?

Part of John McCarthy’s long ago insight (that after 60 years I wish computer people had grokked by now) is tha


Interview's Question: How did Alan Kay first get started with computing?
Alan's kay Answer: I got started via carpet-bombing reading as a just turned teenager in the early 50s. I’m pretty sure that the catalyst wasn’t science fiction because although scifi was into robots it had very little to say about computers in those days (Robert Heinlein d


Interview's Question: How would you design the perfect programming language?
Alan's kay Answer: “ ‘Better’ and ‘Perfect’ are the enemies of ‘What Is Needed’ “

And the latter is usually a qualitative step or more above “normal”. This means that a good heuristic is to try to “dim out” the present and “normal”. For example, we could try to forget abou


Interview's Question: What piece of hardware in a computer matters the absolute most when trying to build a super fast computer?
Alan's kay Answer: Many of the other answers addressed a somewhat different question than the one given.

As Ivan Sutherland (the father of computer graphics and VR/AR etc) recently pointed out at his 80th birthday celebration at SIGGRAPH, in the end the limiting factor and


Interview's Question: How do I learn programming if I hate complexity?
Alan's kay Answer: If you really “hate complexity”, then perhaps you should take a shot at learning programming (really systems design) to see if you can help. Even better if what you really hate is “complication” (In several talks, I’ve made the distinction between “compli


Interview's Question: What are Alan Kay’s Learning Labs?
Alan's kay Answer: A “Learning Lab” was a once a year (sometimes twice) for many years get-together of the most interesting people we knew to share ideas about learning, teaching, epistemology, art, etc., held away from the regular world.

They were usually three day gather


Interview's Question: What did both PARC and the “tonerheads” at Xerox misunderstand about each other?
Alan's kay Answer: Xerox had many different kinds of people; I don’t think of them as “tonerheads”.

And while I was there — 1970 to 1981 — Xerox went through a number of ups and downs — from being “the fastest growing company in the US” in the 60s, to having to write off a


Interview's Question: What was it like to be at Xerox PARC when Bill Gates visited?
Alan's kay Answer: Did he visit?

To my knowledge, he didn’t while I was there (1970–1981).

Austin wrote me to say that he had gotten the idea from this Gates quote: A Rich Neighbor Named Xerox — “Well, Steve, I think there's more than one way of looking at it. I think it'


Interview's Question: How did Alan Kay read 20k books?
Alan's kay Answer: What I actually said was “I’m pretty sure I haven’t read more than 20,000 books”.

I didn’t count them. But I started reading quite early (~ 3 or so) and got fluent pretty quickly, and would be termed “voracious” from age 5 on. I’m 78, so if I read a book


Interview's Question: What was Alan Kay's experience like working at Apple?
Alan's kay Answer: There were many Apples in the period I was there (from about May 1984 to about Sept 1996). This was not just the turnover in Chairmen and CEOs (from Mike Markula, to Steve Jobs to John Sculley to Mike Spindler to Gil Amelio, etc.) but also having the BoD 


Interview's Question: How can I practice to play a classical guitar tremolo faster?
Alan's kay Answer: Lots of good advice in some of the other answers. However, perhaps we can ask a larger question: how can I practice to play a *beautiful* classical guitar tremolo?

In other words: Technique should be the Servant of Art, not the Master.

The quintessentia


Interview's Question: Is there any programmer with 50 years of experience?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ll nominate several of my heroes:

Maurice Wilkes, was the architect and builder and programmer of one of the very first stored program computers — EDSAC ca 1948–9 (which in fact is now being re-created at the UK National Computer Museum in Bletchley Pa


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think of structural editors?
Alan's kay Answer: I haven’t tried a structural editor for so many decades that I don’t think I can comment on what is around today.

Also, I think that liking these or not has partly to do with temperament and style. For example, I turn off the grammar checking in my word 


Interview's Question: What are some ways that programming was better in the past?
Alan's kay Answer: This is the 19th answer — from someone who started programming in the early 60s, and had a sense of how things were in the 50s.

I expected to see in the other answers at least one that pointed out that there was always a range of “computer aided” in how 


Interview's Question: Did Bell Labs and ARPA/PARC ever collaborate?
Alan's kay Answer: In the 60s there weren’t a lot of computer researchers, and they were generally friendly. So more or less everyone knew everyone. If you look at the history of Unix, you will see cross fertilizations both from the MIT Multics research and from Butler Lamp


Interview's Question: How did Xerox PARC do engineering requirements management?
Alan's kay Answer: I was one of the computing researchers at Parc (two of the four labs were devoted to this: Computer Science Lab and Systems Science Lab — the other two were devoted to optics and physics) from a few months after it started in July 1970 to 1981.

I never h


Interview's Question: Why do people see the fretlessness of the violin family as an obstacle? They miss notes just as much in fretted instruments.
Alan's kay Answer: An additional wrinkle not covered in the earlier answers is the question of playing polyphony with “as many voices as the piece demands”.

There are somewhat substantiated theories that the flatter fingerboard and bridge of the older bowed strings — befor


Interview's Question: What is the first IDE you remember using?
Alan's kay Answer: I think that the first UI I used that could carry out interactive development and intermingled live code and live debugging was the CAL system for the Project Genie Time Sharing System (which became the SDS-940, and was used by Engelbart for the “big demo


Interview's Question: Do I lose something when learning OOP in Ruby instead of C#/Java?
Alan's kay Answer: Here’s what I think is a good analogy, but may not have universal reach. After a layoff* of about 4 years from guitar I recently started to learn lute: also with strings and frets and played with most of the fingers on both hands. But: the lute has mostly


Interview's Question: Why does Smalltalk not become a commonly used platform for learning presentations and video lecture constructors? Squeak looks great as an interactive presentation platform for college lecturers.
Alan's kay Answer: Commenting on Eliot Miranda’s answer.

Hi Eliot

Squeak Smalltalk was largely made so we could do Etoys for children: an ancestor and superset of the later Scratch.

From the child’s point of view I wanted it to be an “object media environment” with drag-


Interview's Question: Why don't more classical musicians improvise?
Alan's kay Answer: Lots of very different answers here, partly depending on where in the last 600 or so years one looks. Here I’ll just mention some of the parts of early music that require improvisation, especially continuo (playing “accompaniment” on a chordal instrument 


Interview's Question: Does a computer that has more data/information (huge amount of data) weigh more than the same type and model computer that does not have any data on it?
Alan's kay Answer: There is an old joke — that I heard best told by Butler Lampson — about an aircraft loading engineer who was worried about “the extra weight of data” on punched cards. It was explained to him that a large amount of data actually weighed less because “the 


Interview's Question: What majors are best prepared for jobs that don't exist yet?
Alan's kay Answer: I like Vishnu’s answer. I had planned to sit this question out because I don’t think “job” per se is a big enough idea or goal (just as I don’t think “making money” per se is a good enough idea or goal for business).

I think the trick is to home in on wh


Interview's Question: What's a uni-class?
Alan's kay Answer: My version of “object-oriented” from 1966 on revolved around the active entities in a working system — I thought of these as being “full fledged computers” on a network and communicating via messages (this paralleled and was inspired in part by ARPA’s pla


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think of this remarkable initiative?
Alan's kay Answer: I donated to this because I think some good might come from it. I’m not a fan of competitions — I prefer cooperations — so I think I would have at least cast this in terms of teams, which is also more realistic in what it takes to deal with most important


Interview's Question: What is one moonshot project (as consequential as the ARPANET) should the US government undertake today?
Alan's kay Answer: First, I think that “moonshot project” is not the metaphor you really want to use here: the actual “moonshot” was a stunt that set back real space travel by at least 25 years, and is now looking like more than 50. Also, the government — because of the poo


Interview's Question: Why couldn't the management of Xerox see the goldmine that they had with inventions at Xerox PARC? Was it really about lacking money to capitalize? How about stock issuance?
Alan's kay Answer: Both Giordano Beretta’s and Chuck Brantingham’s answers are good, so I’ll just add a bit more context.

The main sparkplug of Xerox was Joe Wilson, a very special guy who turned over the reins to his protege Peter McColough in the late 60s, who in turn se


Interview's Question: What are some great stories from Xerox PARC?
Alan's kay Answer: There are quite a few online, and this would be appropriate because the ARPA-Parc research community put quite a bit of effort into inventing personal computing and pervasive networking so that people by themselves and with their friends and colleagues co


Interview's Question: Alan Kay, could you give an example of when software development has driven hardware development?
Alan's kay Answer: One way to think about how software helps computing is that it introduces “late-binding” into machinery. The very idea of a “changeable stored program” allows early-bound mechanisms to take on different purposes. I’m a very big fan of the Jacquard loom — 


Interview's Question: What did Steve Jobs mean when he said that Apple is fundamentally a software company? Was he right?
Alan's kay Answer: My slogan in the Xerox Parc years was: “Hardware is just software that is crystallized early”. In other words, the proper business of computerists is dealing with process and processes. Large ideas will lead to software architectures, UIs, languages, and 


Interview's Question: How much percentage of code is shared between software projects, e.g., between a video game and a word processor (in terms of STL, OS, etc)? Is this percentage comparable to the percentage of genetic similarity between mammals?
Alan's kay Answer: One answer to this question can be gleaned by asking yourself how many different text editors you have to use in a week (for example, right now I’m using the Quora editor, I use one for email, another for when I have to chat, and others for writing papers


Interview's Question: Did astronauts on Apollo have the means to kill themselves in case their mission failed?
Alan's kay Answer: I was in the Air Force in the early ‘60s, and part of the flight training then — and likely still today — was to experience various effects of high altitude in an “altitude chamber”. The one we had at James Connelly AFB in Waco Texas would hold about 25 p


Interview's Question: What’s the best book about Charles Babbage in terms of technical detail?
Alan's kay Answer: I would also vote for the Swade book.

In a computer design course I taught many decades ago, I asked the class to design the computer that Captain Nemo would have had on the Nautilus (ca 1865).

A few students tried the Babbage route with mechanics. Most


Interview's Question: What were the best lessons learned at PARC’s Learning Research Group?
Alan's kay Answer: Too big a question for Quora-sized answers (I would have to explain what we did and how we did it, and the last time I did that it turned into a 50 page history for the ACM).

But one thing I did learn that doesn’t require the historical knowledge to unde


Interview's Question: Can someone link me to the original white paper discussing what was eventually coined OOP? I believe it was by Alan Kay, but I'm not able to find it simply in a Google search. I'm finding it referenced, but not linked to, and I don't recall the name.
Alan's kay Answer: Depends on “which OOP” you mean. The kind of language that C++ is, was first created in Simula I, in the mid-60s, and Nygaard and Dahl wrote a paper about it in the CACM in 1966. They reference an earlier document they wrote in Norway in 1965.

The idea o


Interview's Question: How would Apple have benefited if Steve Jobs were technical?
Alan's kay Answer: This is a very complicated question to answer in a fair and comprehensive way. Let me apologize in advance for its length.

Some context: Steve and I were friendly from after the Parc visit until he died. I think that he can’t be too highly praised for ma


Interview's Question: What did Alan Kay and Steve Jobs talk about at the 2007 iPhone keynote?
Alan's kay Answer: Steve and I first met during his visit to Xerox Parc in 1979 at the urging of some of his computer people to see what we’d been doing for the previous 8 years. You can get an idea of this by taking a look at a revived Smalltalk system from the year before


Interview's Question: If a programming language is also written in a programming language, how was the first programming language written?
Alan's kay Answer: Another incomplete offering …

It’s worth looking at “deep bootstrapping” because it helps gain experience with “meta leverage thoughts”. For example, what if there is only one computer with only machine code? Here you have to use the bit-patterns that co


Interview's Question: What is this "live objects" in Smalltalk? I've gotten used to that "edit-compile-test-debug" cycle, and want to understand the philosophy behind Smalltalk (Pharo).
Alan's kay Answer: John Thorpe’s answer is a good start. Now extend the idea to the entire system and think of what we used to call “objects” (now we have to call them “real objects” since “objects” were co-opted in the early 80s) as software computers semantically equivale


Interview's Question: Why did Alan Kay once say GNU/Linux was a budget of bad ideas? What is generally wrong with GNU/Linux, and Unix-like OSes?
Alan's kay Answer: I should learn to keep my big mouth shut (not the first time I’ve had this thought!).

The reason is that it is easy and OK to praise something in a sentence, but I think that a complaint should be backed up with careful discourse. Part of the problem her


Interview's Question: Why is functional programming seen as the opposite of OOP rather than an addition to it?
Alan's kay Answer: I hope for all our sakes that I can make this short …

In the latter part of the 50s John McCarthy got more and more interested in what he started to call “Artificial Intelligence”. He was also doing some consulting and this brought him in contact with th


Interview's Question: Why is engineering one of the hardest fields to be creative? What should engineering education look like instead?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t think that it is intrinsically hard to be creative in engineering.

An important part of engineering is that “the bridge must not fall”, “people must not get hurt”, etc. So people “called”* to engineering always have this at the back of their mind


Interview's Question: Do you recommend receiving a bachelors, masters or doctorate in computer science?
Alan's kay Answer: I recommend the lifelong process of becoming ever more educated, with particular attention to getting above important thresholds of perspective and knowledge.

Because we can’t take “education pills”, we have to work to get our brain/minds to learn and un


Interview's Question: What do you think of the statement that "an object-oriented approach to application development makes programs more intuitive to design, faster to develop, more amenable to modification, and easier to understand"?
Alan's kay Answer: An all encompassing answer from before objects: “You can write COBOL in any language”. (For COBOL, you can substitute Fortran, machine code, spaghetti, etc.)

I quite agree with the other (3 at this point) answers.

This is because clean and elegant softw


Interview's Question: What is the difference between Alan Kay's definition of OOP and Carl Hewitt's Actor Model?
Alan's kay Answer: Not a lot of difference. You can find the history I wrote about all this online in “The Early History Of Smalltalk”.

Basically, I had the “dynamic object as whole computer” idea in Nov 66, highly influenced and catalyzed by Sketchpad and Simula (especial


Interview's Question: When did the CAD->SIM->FAB engineering process become formalized?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m not sure it has, but I think anyone really interested in engineering should find out how things were done before digital computers, and then before analog computers.

There was still a lot of “D” that resulted in models, and those models could be test


Interview's Question: Why is object-oriented programming more about messaging than objects?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ll give a short answer here and then return late for more.

If you are sending messages to “something”, then what kinds of messages do you want to send? For example: are you commanding, are you requesting, are you suggesting, are you negotiating?
If you


Interview's Question: Is it possible to learn any programming language by doing reverse engineering?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m not completely sure of your exact meaning for “reverse engineering”. But at the University of Utah ARPA project the newest grad student was given the toughest task no one there wanted to do.

The one given to me when I arrived in 1966 was to “get Algo


Interview's Question: Are the greatest works of a field performed early on in the field’s lifetime?
Alan's kay Answer: Well, let’s take Physics or Biology, etc., as examples, and let me ask you what do you think?

This is a hallmark of a “real field”. It’s not clear that Computing has gotten there yet — one clue is that “real fields” build on the great work in their past,


Interview's Question: How can I see my design work with a critical eye?
Alan's kay Answer: Mark Twain advised writers looking at their own writing: “If you see a phrase you particularly love, strike it out without hesitation!”.

It helps to “create with love” and “debug with disdain”. If you are critical too early in the process you will kill i


Interview's Question: What are the best resources for learning systems and networks according to Alan Kay?
Alan's kay Answer: Let’s see if we pool efforts to come up with a good answer to this question — especially with more current sources than some that influenced me.

I liked the discussion of systems and design in Christopher Alexander’s “Notes on a Synthesis of Form” from 1


Interview's Question: What has happened to Alan Kay's View Points Research Institute website?
Alan's kay Answer: Looks like a combination of an overzealous bot plus human error. Should be back in a day or so.


Interview's Question: What are the main successes of the AI group at Xerox PARC during the 70s and first half of the 80s? How much influence did it have on other groups (like Smalltalk group) and vice versa?
Alan's kay Answer: Right now I can’t produce the level of answer this question deserves. I’ll have to do some homework and then come back to add and fix.

There were many stellar “Strong AI” (have to use this because “AI” has now been colonized by smaller goals and scopes) 


Interview's Question: What advice would Alan Kay give a curious individual to improve their ability to think and learn? Is there a place to see his library — every book, person, and research he has studied?
Alan's kay Answer: The people I’ve admired — many from afar (such as Bertrand Russell), some as friends and colleagues (such as Jerome Bruner) — share the traits of trying to (a) find ever more perspectives on things they are aware of, (b) find more things they weren’t awar


Interview's Question: How does Alan Kay identify talent in young researchers?
Alan's kay Answer: The wonderful Dave Evans did not look at transcripts, but was interested in resumes and “sparks”. He over-admitted, treated his students like gods, and then (I found out later after I was on the faculty), at around the two year point, the faculty would me


Interview's Question: Why did the federal government invest $117 million into the Radiation Lab, Servomechanism Lab, and the High Voltage Lab at MIT in the 1930s?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m in London right now so don’t have access to my copy of Nilo Lindgren’s book about 100 years of EE at MIT.

But I do recall that both the Rad Lab in Building 20 (eventually invented about half of all the radar systems used in WWII), and the Servo Lab (


Interview's Question: Where did Alan Kay learn about how context affects the ability to think?
Alan's kay Answer: I was lucky enough to learn to read fluently several years before attending school, and by the time I did, had read enough to have encountered different points of view on some of the ideas that were taught as hard truths in first grade. When I piped up an


Interview's Question: What are examples of "Perfect" and "Better" in regards to Alan Kay's "Sweet Spot"?
Alan's kay Answer: Mark Miller’s answer nicely captures much of what I was trying to communicate in the aphorism “Better and Perfect are the enemies of ‘What is Actually Needed’”.

The one thing I might add is that one of several useful ways to think about the “MacCready” s


Interview's Question: What does it mean for a language to have Smalltalk-inspired syntax?
Alan's kay Answer: There are three main answers to this question because there were three somewhat different Smalltalks (‘72, ‘74, then ‘76, ‘78, then ‘80).

In the first version, each object was passed a reference to the message, and did the work itself to parse and deciph


Interview's Question: If you had to choose just one word for your gravestone, what would it be?
Alan's kay Answer: Curious


Interview's Question: What will happen if one rewrites the entire Linux using Smalltalk?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m going to translate this question into “What are good ways to rethink operating systems in our day and age?”

We generally assume that we have computer(s) that not only have CPU(s), memories of various kinds, and connections to networks, but that incor


Interview's Question: What exactly is WYSIWYG?
Alan's kay Answer: What I am doing right now is *not* WYSIWYG.

For no good reason, and several bad ones, the Quora text input system (and most others in web browsers) make you type into a separate area that is decoupled from where it will wind up and what it will look like


Interview's Question: Could a modern-day Xerox PARC be funded through Patreon?
Alan's kay Answer: There’s coming up with the funding, coming up with the visions, and coming up with the people.

Butler Lampson estimated that the number of computer researchers at Parc during its most productive early years was “about two dozen”. I.e. “tiny”. I think the


Interview's Question: Why is it possible to use an object as a parameter directly?
Alan's kay Answer: In Smalltalk, everything is an object and it does pass parameters, so …

As to “why?”, it’s worth thinking about what a data structure “knows”, what the receiver of a data structure needs to know, what an object knows, and what the receiver of an object n


Interview's Question: What resources does Alan Kay recommend for learning real object oriented programming?
Alan's kay Answer: Following on to Mark Miller’s answer

One resource for morphogenesis would be “Endless Forms Most Beautiful” by Sean Carroll.

We get children started on systems by having them make systems with lots of parts — like epidemics, the foxes and the rabbits, “


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think of the Swift programming language?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t think my opinion matters. But it’s worth looking at the stated goals for the particular design and implementation of any programming language and (a) see how well they match up to the system in use, and (b) what important goals have been left out.


Interview's Question: If Tony Hoare said that “debugging is harder than programming and you shouldn’t use all of your cleverness to write the program” — or make anything — then what role does planning have in engineering and software design?
Alan's kay Answer: The famous Tacoma Narrows bridge that vibrated itself to bits in a strong wind was planned, but the means to do a good simulation did not exist when it was built. Today, we would expect that a bridge we built would anticipate most stresses. The old joke w


Interview's Question: Can Smalltalk code be written on "bare metal" hardware?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m not sure I understand this question, but -sure-!

When a bunch of us were at HP in the mid-2000s we did a bakeoff for a children’s machine (a few years before OLPC) where there was not really enough room for the speed, graphics ability, and low power 


Interview's Question: What are some good books on history of computing?
Alan's kay Answer: This is a very good question! I’m in the UK for a while right now and don’t have access to my home library, so I’ll add to this answer incrementally as I think of more items. However, I also invite all readers of this to provide some of their favorite his


Interview's Question: How does a program like Microsoft Excel get written from scratch?
Alan's kay Answer: One good answer is “find out how Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston did the original spreadsheet Visicalc on the 8-bit micro Apple II”.

Another approach is that the abstraction of a spreadsheet is simple, so make a prototype using any language that can make 


Interview's Question: What is software architecture in layman's terms?
Alan's kay Answer: When a term is borrowed from somewhere else — for example: “science”, “engineering”, or “archtecture” — it is usually important to start with what the terms meant in the developed serious disciplines they were taken from. So we should ask “what is modern 


Interview's Question: What is the best way to promote a non-traditional Smalltalk programming language implementation?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t know, I’ve never tried to promote any kind of programming language. Certainly, the things that have attracted me to various programming languages have mainly been compelling examples. I think this is the place to start.


Interview's Question: What did Alan Kay mean by, "Lisp is the greatest single programming language ever designed"?
Alan's kay Answer: First, let me clear up a few misconceptions from the previous answers. One of them said “Try writing an operating system with Lisp”, as though this would be somehow harder. In fact, one of the nicest operating systems ever done was on “The Lisp Machines” 


Interview's Question: Is there a programming language that's effectively a successor to Smalltalk?
Alan's kay Answer: Well, let's see. The first usable Smalltalk was designed and implemented by the end of 1972. That makes it 45 years old, and the main ideas about OOP I contributed go back to the end of 1966 (that makes this particular line of thought — dynamic programmab


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay use in lieu of PowerPoint?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ve given a lot of talks using Etoys (in Squeak), a programming environment we made for children (starting at Disney in the late 90s) that also had decent media design. The current day Scratch is a subset descendant of Etoys, but without many of the usef


Interview's Question: As a beginner, what are the best ways to approach Computer Science?
Alan's kay Answer: If you are just looking to get a job in computing, don’t bother to read further.

First, there are several things to get clear with regard to any field.

What is the best conception of what the field is about?
What is the best above threshold knowledge to


Interview's Question: What are the backgrounds of engineer-scientists and scientist-engineers?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t know how to give a reasonable answer (because there is quite a spread in personalities, skills, and knowledge across the very large fields). But, I can give a “non-reasonable” attempt at this. If you take “STEM”, realize that the “T” for “Technolo


Interview's Question: If computer science looked more like engineering, what would "software simulators" do?
Alan's kay Answer: Let’s try to use as parallel analogies as possible to “science” (what physics, chemistry, biology, etc.) do, and to “engineering” (what civil, electrical, mechanical, bio-, etc. engineering do).

And let’s also look for interesting overlaps. For example, 


Interview's Question: What does Alan Kay think about Gerry Sussman's recent talk at the Strange Loop conference titled "We Really Don't Know How to Compute!"?
Alan's kay Answer: I like to read rather than watch videos. I’ve always been a big fan of Gerry since he was a grad student at MIT, and have generally agreed with him. If he is complaining about current programming and programming languages then he is probably right and I’d


Interview's Question: How do you know when you have the chops to build your own tools?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t know a good general answer. The ARPA-Parc gang got some sense of it by building tools, and sometimes undergoing what Butler Lampson once referred to as “bitter experience”. In those days of new computer architectures and non-standardized operating


Interview's Question: What did Alan Kay mean by, "I made up the term object-oriented, and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind."?
Alan's kay Answer: It’s hard to praise too highly the programming languages that are the bridge from one way of looking at programming to much better ways of looking at programming. The two greatest such in the 60s were Lisp and Simula. Perhaps the greatest single conceptio


Interview's Question: I don't want be a specialist. How can I be a great generalist in computer science?
Alan's kay Answer: Every once in a while I’m asked “What does it mean to be a Computer Scientist?”. My answer is “I don’t know exactly, but take a look at Butler Lampson. He is certainly the quintessential Computer Scientist if ever there was one”.

We find in Butler someon


Interview's Question: How could public libraries disrupt themselves?
Alan's kay Answer: Libraries made their way in the US partly because they provided something not easily found otherwise. Still, it’s sobering to realize that about half of all the libraries in the US by about 1920 were there because they were funded by a single philanthropi


Interview's Question: What was the total economic impact of research at Xerox parc in the 1970s?
Alan's kay Answer: Hard to nail down and substantiate (and it would be good and interesting to do so). Some years ago I saw an estimate — I think from a university — that said “in excess of $30 Trillion dollars, perhaps as much as $35T”. I have no idea whether this was real


Interview's Question: What was Xerox PARC's mission statement?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t recall one — I’m pretty sure — not totally — that there wasn’t an “official” one. But the intent of Jack Goldman — the Chief Scientist of Xerox, a physicist, who decided to make PARC — was to devote a small percentage of Xerox’s R&D resources to “


Interview's Question: If you had to teach ‘Computer Science 101’, how would you begin your first lecture?
Alan's kay Answer: Let’s think about this question for a bit. Some years ago I was invited by “CS Departments” to give talks at a number of universities. Almost accidentally I asked the first audience of undergrads, grad students and professors for their definition of “Comp


Interview's Question: How would you interpret Marvin Minsky's idea that “Computer science already has a grammar. What it needs is a literature.”?
Alan's kay Answer: The most interesting aspect of Ken’s blog entry (including the comments) is that nowhere do we find an historical reference to this idea. In fact, more than 50 years earlier in the 60s it was a part of many a conversation, and if I recall correctly, a few


Interview's Question: As a true engineer, how do you figure out what are the right tools to invent to help you do your work?
Alan's kay Answer: I’ve worked with “true engineers” and I think of myself as an “enthusiastic hobbyist” with some “scientific leanings”. Despite this much of what I’ve done over the last 50 years has very large engineering components (you have to build things in computing 


Interview's Question: What books would Alan Kay recommend for people who want to become true engineers? How should they go about building projects?
Alan's kay Answer: As with science, medicine, counseling, and many other fields, I think there are issues of temperament as well as knowledge — there is a kind of “calling” here. And, I think, a kind of “attitude”.

Henry Petroski is an engineer who has written a number of 


Interview's Question: In software engineering, is it better to just figure it out and hack together a solution or to understand the fundamentals and then implement it?
Alan's kay Answer: Interesting range of answers so far …

The first question I would ask is whether you are taking the word “engineering” seriously or is your notion of “software engineering” an oxymoron, or an ancient sense of the word, as in “Library Science”.

If you wan


Interview's Question: What do you think the next great invention of the 21st century will be? One as big as the internet. This idea of synthetic realities is something I see having huge potential.
Alan's kay Answer: Really smart people — like Ivan Sutherland — can figure out most of the implications of new ideas and technologies from the get go. Take a look at his 1965 paper The Ultimate Display and see what you think about your question. Then you could take a look t


Interview's Question: What are those "powerful ideas that basically mean the difference between life and death"?
Alan's kay Answer: You can identify many of them. Two types are (a) “powerful ideas that have immediate benefit on life and death” — for example, the germ theory of disease and what is implied for sanitation, being able to make insulin to save diabetics, and a myriad more h


Interview's Question: Why did Xerox fail to successfully exploit any of its ideas at its Palo Alto Research Center from the 1960s and 1970s?
Alan's kay Answer: A common myth (and easily exposed with a little poking of the web). The simplest one is “the 60s” (Xerox Parc started in 1970).

Depending on how you count, there were around 7–9 major computer related inventions from Xerox Parc in the 70s. One of them wa


Interview's Question: What is Alan Kay’s opinion of Assembly and mainstream programming languages like Google Go?
Alan's kay Answer: John von Neumann was famously against using valuable expensive computer time to automate human tasks that could be done by cheap labor. When FORTRAN came out in 1956 someone asked him about “higher level programming”. He summoned a grad student and said “


Interview's Question: "If you don't fail at least 90 percent of the time, you're not aiming high enough." - Alan Kay. What are some things Alan Kay has aimed for and failed at?
Alan's kay Answer: Most things. (Consider the world of the idealist …)

A big turning point in my late 20s was to gradually move to evaluating on “quality of effort” rather than “quality of results” (still wanting the latter to be high, but eventually recognizing the real c


Interview's Question: In Alan Kay’s answer about the best books to understand CS concepts, he mentioned that he would look for an excellent follow-on book to the “The Pattern on the Stone” book. Has he found it?
Alan's kay Answer: There probably is at least one really good book out there that could be a follow-on to Danny’s “Pattern in the Stone” book — but I haven’t come across it. Perhaps some of the Quora readers can make suggestions.

I’ve known Danny since he was a teenager, a


Interview's Question: What are some new kinds of businesses you would like to see?
Alan's kay Answer: The economist Milton Friedman — perhaps the epitome of “dismal” in “the dismal science”? — famously declared that the sole purpose of business is to make money for the shareholders.

A larger deeper mind — Peter Drucker — countered with the idea that the 


Interview's Question: What are Alan Kay's favorite books?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t know how to give a reasonable answer to this question, but I don’t want to ignore the question either.

I have friends, and know of people, who have certainly read more books than I have, but I’ve read enough to be stymied by questions about “favo


Interview's Question: What if we were able to prove that AGI is beyond the computational power of the Turing machine?
Alan's kay Answer: I think Cherie Woo below has a good approach to this (it was the philosophical approach used in the 60s for doubters of “eventual AI”).

Philosophically, the question is “Can we in principle simulate physics well enough to make the biology we have, and to


Interview's Question: To what extent, if at all, did Smalltalk borrow from Lisp's philosophy or ideas?
Alan's kay Answer: As Mark Miller noted below, a fairly complete history of Smalltalk can be found in The Early History Of Smalltalk. Part of the history is an explanation of how long it took me to see the deep implications of what was in front of me (this is because I star


Interview's Question: What tools are useful when outlining and drafting a CS dissertation?
Alan's kay Answer: The number one tool is to have good results that are worth writing up. Too many dissertations these days are too incremental, and often from small papers done over the course of grad school — try to work on a real problem, and get real results. Dave Evans


Interview's Question: What are the pros and cons of developing software from the top-down and from the bottom-up?
Alan's kay Answer: Somewhat harmonious with some of the other answers: try making a small scratch throwaway working model first to get an overall sense of the system design and relationships needed.

This is especially useful when working in a language system that has a hug


Interview's Question: What do Alan Kay and other message-oriented programming pioneers think about Ruby?
Alan's kay Answer: The real question is: how should programming really be done ca 2017? And let’s also pick a check point around 2027 to help think about my first question.


Interview's Question: Has PARC (formerly Xerox PARC) become just another company? Has it lost its original identity?
Alan's kay Answer: Parc was four laboratories: Physics, Optics, Computer Science, and Systems. The last two were the most associated with what people think of as “Parc”, and the deeds most associated with “Parc” were mostly done between 1971 and 1983 when Bob Taylor and mos


Interview's Question: How much cash did Xerox have on hand when it formed Xerox PARC?
Alan's kay Answer: Worth checking. My recollection is that they were about a $6B/year (1970–71 dollars) company at the time Parc was set up.


Interview's Question: What kind of cheese makes the best grilled cheese sandwich? Why?
Alan's kay Answer: Kind of redundant given all the answers, but this is the kind of dish that we react to personally … a great grilled cheese sandwich is my favorite comfort food, and my notion of it is from the ones my mother used to make for us in New England in the 40s a


Interview's Question: What is the meaning of life in 5 words?
Alan's kay Answer: “We make our own meanings”


Interview's Question: What was it like to be at Xerox PARC when Steve Jobs visited?
Alan's kay Answer: A good enough answer would be longer than is reasonable for Quora, but I can supply a few comments to highlight just how little attention is paid in the media, histories, and by most people to find out what actually happened. For example, I was present at


Interview's Question: Who was the first to introduce multiple desktops, Linux or macOS?
Alan's kay Answer: I hate to bring up the “P” word, but Smalltalk at Parc had unlimited persistent multiple desktops starting in the mid-70s with Smalltalk-76. They were called “projects”. All Smalltalk systems since have this as part of the system’s offerings.

Interview's Question: What is your review of The HP Way (1995 book)?
Alan's kay Answer: Interesting that Quora will not allow me to write an additional answer … so I’ll flesh out what I wrote previously, which starts with:

I’m currently traveling, and would like to take a peek at the book to make sure I remember it from getting and reading 


Interview's Question: Why did Alan Kay say MS-DOS was a distressing thing?
Alan's kay Answer: I believe that you can praise in a few sentences, but that criticism morally demands longer and more careful arguments. I don’t know how to be fair about a criticism on this subject in a Quora-sized answer, but I can point you in a few directions to see w


Interview's Question: How can life form from nothing?
Alan's kay Answer: There are four parts to this.

1. The easy part is that many constructed things have very different properties than their parts. For example, we can start off with materials that don’t do what wheels do, and yet make a wheel, make a car, make a radio, etc


Interview's Question: Have screenshots of the Xerox Parc GUI ever been published?
Alan's kay Answer: Sure, here’s one of Smalltalk-80[1] and here’s a much earlier one from Smalltalk-74[2] Here’s an image of Smalltalk-76[3] from a paper Dan Ingalls wrote in 1978.

Here’s a Dorado screen with one of the Smalltalks (maybe Smalltalk-78)[4]. There are quite a


Interview's Question: Why haven't we been able to recreate Bell Labs or Xerox PARC today?
Alan's kay Answer: The computer parts of Parc are best thought of as parts of the ARPA-IPTO research community, were stocked with researchers who carried the ARPA vision, and who learned their stuff and process in the ARPA community. Looking back on that experience, and at 


Interview's Question: What's Alan Kay’s opinion of the D programming language?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t think I know enough about D to have a supported opinion. I’m not a fan of C or C++ (but not because they aren’t like Smalltalk …)


Interview's Question: How did Ivan Sutherland create Sketchpad? What programming language did he use?
Alan's kay Answer: Take a look at Ivan’s “Commemorative Lecture” for the Kyoto Prize for some insight into his special mind. Everyone should read Ivan’s thesis — Sketchpad, A Man-Machine Communication System (1963) — one of the greats of all time, and it also answers your q


Interview's Question: What did Claude Shannon do and accomplish according to Alan Kay?
Alan's kay Answer: The Wikipedia article is a good place to start, and supplies references for reading by and about Claude Shannon, in my opinion a “real genius” who ranked with just a few people in the 20th century for unique insights and ability to go to great depths with


Interview's Question: When did Alan Kay first meet Douglas Engelbart? Was Alan Kay present at the mother of all demos?
Alan's kay Answer: I first met Doug when he gave a talk at Utah in early 1967. As I’ve said, he was like a “Moses opening the Red Sea”. I then visited the ARC research project at SRI in Menlo Park and met many of the principal characters in the revolution they were fomentin


Interview's Question: For Alan Kay, what was Claude Shannon like?
Alan's kay Answer: I didn’t know Claude Shannon (but among other things he was Ivan Sutherland’s advisor at MIT (in part because he met the Sutherland brothers a number of times when they were youngsters when he was at Bell Labs). Marvin Minsky was a good friend of Shannon’


Interview's Question: How many of the great engineers from Xerox PARC came from backgrounds with low family incomes?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t know (and most of the researchers at Parc were a mix of “scientists, engineers, mathematicians, computerists”.

And I’m not sure what you mean by “low family incomes” (desperate? very little surplus?). I wound up working my way through college for


Interview's Question: Alan Kay, how should libraries be designed so scientists and engineers can work together more?
Alan's kay Answer: This “isn’t quite a question” so here is “not quite an answer” — Doug Engelbart, who was a great thinker about the possibilities for helping humanity with the aid of shared interactive computing, wrote much and showed much about needs and ways to boost co


Interview's Question: Alan Kay: How do you identify favorable exponentials?
Alan's kay Answer: I think this question happened because I used “Moore’s Law” as an example of a “favorable exponential” that could be used to help think about “progress by going out into the future and bringing it back”.

Most of the time I’ve first noted exponentials, an


Interview's Question: Why was Bob Taylor fired from Xerox in 1983?
Alan's kay Answer: There were large “differences” with the new head of Parc. I had already left by then and at that time was Chief Scientist of Atari.


Interview's Question: For Alan Kay, if the present is distracting, then how should you optimally ignore it? What did the team do at Xerox PARC?
Alan's kay Answer: By coincidence, I got asked to do several lectures (this week) at Stanford on “Escaping The Tyranny Of The Present”. I think the one from Tuesday just got posted (and perhaps even the one from today).

Take a look at: How to Invent the Future I - Alan Kay


Interview's Question: What did JCR Licklider mean when he said if the internet succeeds our biggest problem will be to communicate with aliens?
Alan's kay Answer: Lick basically meant that, as scaling increases, the chances to have the shared contexts that communication requires get thinner and scarcer.

This is true between humans and humans (at some point you have to stop trying to send telegrams and send an amba


Interview's Question: What do classical music lovers think of rap?
Alan's kay Answer: I really enjoyed all of the other answers — perhaps my favorite collection of responses to date on Quora.

Part of my background is 9 years of being a professional jazz musician (on guitar, starting in the late 50s), composing experience, many decades to 


Interview's Question: What is the most expressive piece of art that you have ever seen?
Alan's kay Answer: It’s worth asking to what extent “art” can be sorted, even by a single person. I think the latter can at least create a category called “great” and include works in it (this is harder for a group to do, but it’s possible for them to agree on some to be pu


Interview's Question: Why does imperfect computation have market power?
Alan's kay Answer: Why does imperfect music — even bad music — have market power?


Interview's Question: What’s the point of life if we all die?
Alan's kay Answer: The point of life is to live life with a point. We are the creatures who are aware that we’ll die, but we also are the creatures who create our own reasons for living. Don’t worry about the universe. Find a point.


Interview's Question: Why is squaring both sides of an equation allowed?
Alan's kay Answer: Let me confess that I’ve not read every answer. But the ones that I did read were all very concerned with “squaring” etc.

The simplest answer — and I think the reason many people have difficulty with both arithmetic and especially algebra — is that you n


Interview's Question: What is the user interface of next generation messenger?
Alan's kay Answer: Hi Jenifa Could you try asking your question in a different way? This will help me understand what you would like to know …


Interview's Question: What are the best books to understand computer science concepts?
Alan's kay Answer: By far the best book for the general public — the one I always recommend — is “The Pattern on the Stone” by Danny Hillis.

I have several thousand books about computation, but I can’t think of a great next level book. There must be one by now, so it will 


Interview's Question: If an alien civilisation came to Earth and found computers, how long would they take to figure out exactly how they work (reverse engineer them)?
Alan's kay Answer: I agree with Vivian (I was just in the process of formulating something similar, but she said it shorter and better).

On the other hand — not quite an answer — every computer person should be aware of what the Silverman brothers have done in making old h


Interview's Question: If you want to program and you can't use your smartphone and computer how you can code?
Alan's kay Answer: Programming is relatively easy, it’s debugging that’s the problem. Or as Tony Hoare once noted “Programming is easier than debugging, so don’t use all your cleverness writing the program!”

I started in the early 60s (in the Air Force), on two different m


Interview's Question: What does the expression "Betcha by Golly Wow" mean?
Alan's kay Answer: “Betcha” comes from “you betcha” which comes from “you bet” which means “YES!”.

“By golly” is one of many ways to say “By god” if you want to avoid really swearing.

“Wow” means “Holy shit!” means “that’s amazing”

The whole phrase is an hyperbolic excla


Interview's Question: How is studying undergraduate computer science at CU Boulder?
Alan's kay Answer: They didn’t have it when I was there (graduated in 66 with a math degree)


Interview's Question: How can I come up with an ISEF project relating to Computer Science?
Alan's kay Answer: I’m not a fan of competitions where art is a big factor (and it should be here, not just for your learning and doing, but also to carry with you later).

And … it’s usually much much better to do things that really intrigue you that also push into computi


Interview's Question: Will graphical user interfaces ever be taken over by voice user interfaces?
Alan's kay Answer: Will classical pipe organs ever be supplanted by singers (or vice versa)? Will people who like to make things with tools ever want to have servants do the best work? …


Interview's Question: What made Xerox PARC special? Who else today is like them?
Alan's kay Answer: A good book (pretty much the only good book) to read about the research community that Parc was a part of is “The Dream Machine” by Mitchell Waldrop. There you will find out about the ARPA (before the “D”) IPTO (Information Processing Techniques Office) s


Interview's Question: Are Smalltalk and Pharo out-dated?
Alan's kay Answer: Sure. What’s disappointing is that Smalltalk is still quite comparable to most programming languages in use today (and not always negatively).

This means that the computing establishment has done a terrible job in coming up with something qualitatively b


Interview's Question: People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware. Why?
Alan's kay Answer: The first part of the idea is that computing is about -processes- (all kinds) both understanding them and making them.

At the next level of practicality, if one is making something that is supposed to be good for people to use — that actually might help 


Interview's Question: How can I understand physics instead of just memorizing equations and facts?It really frustrates me how I only have to memorize equations and just work my way through school without understanding anything.
Alan's kay Answer: There are lots of good approaches here. I’d start with thinking about -processes- rather than “relationships” or “words” — and combine this with some experiments (a great thing about the dawn of “real science” in the 17th through 19th century is that a lo


Interview's Question: What does a good object oriented design for a football game look like?
Alan's kay Answer: I left inheritance out of the first Smalltalk because I didn’t like the way Simula’s single hierarchies missed important relationships and I didn’t like the lack of expression of meaning (you could refine a superclass or create a new species, etc., and Si


Interview's Question: What are the benefits of learning to programme in Smalltalk?
Alan's kay Answer: Take a look at In what way would learning Smalltalk make me a better programmer? for some opinions around a very similar question.


Interview's Question: In what way would learning Smalltalk make me a better programmer?
Alan's kay Answer: I think the crux of a question like this is to note the old saying that “You can do COBOL programming in any programming language!” In other words, the start is what you bring to a programming language. If it’s an already formed theory and skills about ho


Interview's Question: Did some Xerox PARC engineers understand that they had the technology that can change the world in the 70’s?
Alan's kay Answer: Sure! Lee Felsenstein is quite right that the Parc researchers — we weren’t all strictly “engineers”, but a mixture of different types who could all do some mixture of engineering, science, mathematics, computing, cognitive psychology, etc. — aimed explic


Interview's Question: Why does my school aged kid ask inane questions like "what is gravity made of" or what is a "field made of" rather than just learn the material? How do I discourage this so they can get good marks?
Alan's kay Answer: If you assert that you are not kidding here, I’ll be happy to answer your question.


Interview's Question: What was working at Xerox PARC in the early 1970s like?
Alan's kay Answer: Best time ever! A truly wonderful combination of great people with great aspirations, abilities, and determination.

And great (and needed) protection for the critical years by the “impressario” (as he liked to call himself) Bob Taylor.


Interview's Question: What is Xerox PARC’s contribution to the world?
Alan's kay Answer: A good book to read — which gives the larger story of the ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) research projects starting in 1962 and how Parc was part of this community and budded from it — is “The Dream Machine” by Mitchell Waldrop.

I t


Interview's Question: If I am auditioning for a Shakespeare play, should I do an English accent for an audition or should I just use my normal voice?
Alan's kay Answer: I agree with the other answers that you should concentrate on pulling off a speech before all else. Clarity and rhythm are the watchwords. Getting it over the footlights with “quiet conviction” and not too much movement — but with “body attitudes” — is th


Interview's Question: Is Alan Kay's statement “science is a set of heuristics to get around buggy brains” a reference to Nietzsche's knowledge-as-preservation?
Alan's kay Answer: No — but an interesting question. This statement is my translation into modern terms of some of Francis Bacon’s observations and calls to action in his “Novum Organum Scientia” (ca 1620), where among many other things he identifies 4 “idols that humans wo


Interview's Question: I really dislike (to put it mildly) the new Quora UI/UX. Both web and mobile. Am I the only one?
Alan's kay Answer: Why introduce modes for expanding answers — by making a popup that forces closing to get back — when expanding them in the scrolling galley was the best solution, and that is what you had. This is “reinventing the flat tire”!

Please change it back.


Interview's Question: What is it like to work with Adele Goldberg?
Alan's kay Answer: I first met Adele when I was putting together my research group at Xerox Parc in its earliest days, and she was a computer scientist (U of Chicago) finishing her PhD working with Pat Suppes at Stanford on an interactive system for helping young children l


Interview's Question: How does one develop a really strong intuition for mathematics and physics? How can I improve my ability to solve "really challenging" physics/math problems?
Alan's kay Answer: I enjoyed reading all of the other answers. One thing to ponder is that your two questions are not necessarily compatible.

And let’s use a less lofty label than “intuition” — how about “guessing”?

(See Kahneman’s “Thinking: Fast and Slow” for his “expos


Interview's Question: As voice interfaces get better, how will we draw the line between where we use visual UIs vs. voice?
Alan's kay Answer: Jared Zimmerman’s answer is good. One thing he didn’t mention — in general, with regard to semi-Is as interface assistants — is trust — and how it can be dealt with continuously.

For example, in a reactive GUI, we learn to trust most cause and effect rel


Interview's Question: IT scientists often say about other scientists that they don't know how to structure software code. Are there ways to learn it without studying CS?
Alan's kay Answer: Most code is not “well structured”, even by experienced programmers (even by experienced “structurers”). The early stages of programming are often more experimental than one would hope, and experienced programmers will sometimes take the trouble to try to


Interview's Question: What are the difficulties of creating "smart APIs", where two programs can automatically figure out a way to talk to each other?
Alan's kay Answer: Great question!

It's worth looking at some similar observations over the years (apologies in advance for the length of this reply).

JCR Licklider -- the great originator (1962) and funder of ARPA-IPTO -- in 1963 called for an "Intergalactic Network", an


Interview's Question: How do I learn object-oriented programming?
Alan's kay Answer: Like “Computer Science” — which had a very different and much better meaning when first coined in the 60s (in part, it represented real aspirations towards finding the strongest notions of itself) — “Object-Oriented Programming”, when I coined the term ab


Interview's Question: What are 5 most interesting and well-paid jobs in CS?
Alan's kay Answer: “Real Science” like any great art form is a “calling” not a “job”.

I realize that the use of “Science” in “Computer Science” has now lost its original meaning and intent, and is now more like the usage in “Library Science”. However, as an old fogey who l


Interview's Question: How can I learn to create computer-generated music?
Alan's kay Answer: Which part of your question is more important: “music” or “computer-generated”?

“The music is not in the piano”! So if “music” is the more important part — I think it should be — then developing the internal musical tendencies given to us by our genetics


Interview's Question: What is BIOS? What are its characteristics and functions?
Alan's kay Answer: With all due respect, this is not a “theoretical computer science question”, or even a “computer science” question (“real computer science” (RCS) is distinct in many ways in what it is trying to do from practical engineering). I use RCS here because this 


Interview's Question: How does one mathematize code and write bit-identical code for all platforms?
Alan's kay Answer: I don’t think I have used the term “mathematized code”. I have suggested (and my research community has used) the tactic of coming up with “mathematics” for important ideas, and then trying to turn the math into a runnable computer language (also a kind o


Interview's Question: How are programs with a user interface made?
Alan's kay Answer: There is “what?” and there is “how?”. We can guess that “what?”is difficult in numerous ways, because there are many poor UI designs to be seen these days, even with components supplied by OSs and libraries. Quite a bit of good UI design requires deep und


Interview's Question: What is a good advanced OOP course that is equivalent to CS108 at Stanford?
Alan's kay Answer: There is much too much unsubstantiated criticism on the web. I think real criticism should be just the opposite: highly supported with lots of counter examples, etc.

So, having looked at the webpage for CS 108 at Stanford — Object Oriented Programming — 


Interview's Question: What is Alan Kay's definition of Object Oriented?
Alan's kay Answer: The other answers are well worth reading. An interesting question arises about terminology: to what extent is it reasonable to try to retain original definitions versus having a term get “softer” in meaning as time passes and new and additional conception


Interview's Question: How difficult is Stanford's CS231N?
Alan's kay Answer: This is not a “Computer Science question”, it is a question about academics at a particular institution.


Interview's Question: At OOPSLA 1997 Alan Kay gave a talk titled "The computer revolution hasn't happened yet". What parts have materialized thus far and if not why not?
Alan's kay Answer: The excellent answers by Mark Miller and by Tyson Edwards both get at some of the problems with “a real computer revolution”.

One of the analogies, and questions, we used 50 years ago to think about this was to the printing press, and “when did the real 


Interview's Question: Is an iPad that boots into Squeak (or Croquet) effectively Alan Kay's dynabook?
Alan's kay Answer: The short answer is “No”, despite the iPad having vastly more computing, storage, display, network, and battery resources than the “Dynabook model” thought up in 1968 and sketched in several papers in 1972 and afterwards. http://mprove.de/diplom/gui/Kay72


Interview's Question: Is Alan Kay correct that building software is still like the design and construction of ancient structures like the Pyramids, in the era before architecture?
Alan's kay Answer: The essay quoted was written in 2001. And, 15 years later, it’s still a good question, but I think harder to answer — and especially for me: I haven’t been tracking software development generally for a number of years (and there’s been a lot more of it).



Interview's Question: Where can I find/listen to music recordings featuring Alan Kay the computer scientist?
Alan's kay Answer: I played jazz guitar around NY and Denver from about 1957 to 1966, and wound up quitting the next year because I couldn’t do the practicing I needed and do grad school at the University of Utah at the same time. (I was the kind of player that needed to pr


Interview's Question: What was the first novel for Daniel Defoe?
Alan's kay Answer: I didn’t know much about Daniel Defoe — except Robinson Crusoe, Moll Flanders, etc., and that he was very early in the English Novel and a prolific writer.

But the Wikipedia article was very interesting — did you consult it? — it lists Robinson Crusoe as


Interview's Question: How does one explain the phenomenon of "being on autopilot"?
Alan's kay Answer: Almost all of our behaviors — including much of what we like to call “thinking” — is done “on autopilot”.

Perhaps too simple — but I think still useful — is what Daniel Kahneman in his book “Thinking Fast and Slow” calls “System 1” (all the mechanisms we


Interview's Question: How can you add more value as a user interface or user experience designer in the team?
Alan's kay Answer: The reason even the few good UI designs are “so-so” is that we still don’t understand enough about human beings to do great designs, especially ones that — like musical instruments — can elevate human expression and thought as they are learned and used.




Interview's Question: Are there any books (apart from 'Dealers of Lightning' and 'Fumbling the Future') about PARC's rise and fall from grace?
Alan's kay Answer: “Fumbling The Future” is a poor book to read. Michael Hiltzik, who wrote “Dealers of Lightning”, did a fair amount of research, but the book is marred by “the heroes’ journey” tropes and confusing timelines.

“The Dream Machine” by Mitchell Waldrop, on th


Interview's Question: Has anyone criticized Alan Kay?
Alan's kay Answer: As Mark Miller mentioned, Dijkstra once said that "Object-Oriented Programming was such a bad idea that it could only have come from California"! However, he and I were friendly, so I took that as a backhanded compliment. My research group at Xerox Parc w


Interview's Question: As a computer science major, I want to develop my mathematical problem solving skills. So, what books are good for developing problem solving skills?
Alan's kay Answer: I like both the previous answers, especially the "until your fingers bleed" one! I should add the classic by Polya "How To Solve It" to the reading list. For a more contemporary look I suggest tuning into the Abel, Fields and Turing Laureates Meet the Nex


Interview's Question: Can we have garbage collection and memory management on a fully-compiled language? That is, no VM or interpreter required?
Alan's kay Answer: Sure!

As others have also answered "yes", I thought I'd just add a couple of side notes.

First, there are many techniques for storage reclamation, and it's worth looking at them. We used reference counting at Parc in the 70s because we had real-time mus


Interview's Question: How does imagery affect tone in literature?
Alan's kay Answer: This sounds like the "criticism" classes I was able to avoid in both English literature and in music. More worthwhile using the time to do more reading and playing! (Since most ideas -- and books -- are mediocre down to bad, it's a good idea to encounter 


Interview's Question: I don't understand properly Alan Kay's quote about his math background. Can anyone explain it in layman terms?
Alan's kay Answer: Sometimes things can be nicely simplified yet made more powerful at the same time. This is often "what 'math' is good for".

When I looked at how Ivan Sutherland had organized the objects in Sketchpad -- (1962) the first real interactive graphics system (


Interview's Question: What are proxemics in drama? How are they implemented?
Alan's kay Answer: I don't think I know anything special about this subject, beyond just the rules of thumb that are used on the stage to relate actors to each other spatially, and sometimes to "special objects".

For a given play and given actors, the same director can be 


Interview's Question: What is the primary reason Willy Loman kills himself in Death of a Salesman?
Alan's kay Answer: One way to approach this is to look up the definition(s) of classical "tragedy" and see what a playwright might try to do today in a more inclusive society in which the larger bulk of humanity is attempted to be treated as important.

Then, you can ask th


Interview's Question: What were Sophocles' contributions to theatrical drama?
Alan's kay Answer: I thought the wikipedia article on Sophocles was pretty good -- I suggest perusing it.

The corresponding wikipedia article on Greek theater was less comprehensive -- and then there is the question of "theater" itself, and the means and purpose of the tra


Interview's Question: Is a microservices architecture with RESTful APIs an implementation of Alan Kay's concept of object-oriented programming?
Alan's kay Answer: I was asked to write a history of Smalltalk for the ACM History of Programming Languages II conference in the early 90s -- an online version is: The Early History Of Smalltalk. This will make more clear some of the influences.

For our purposes here, whil


Interview's Question: Will the code on p.13 of the LISP 1.5 Programmers Manual by John McCarthy and friends ever be taught in a physics class?
Alan's kay Answer: How about Biology in a Computer Science class? I think a way to make progress here is to try to appreciate what of the past can actually help thinking about the future.

For example, there is a lot to inspire in Lisp and in McCarthy's ideas -- and perhaps


Interview's Question: Who was specifically responsible for the invention of the "windows" GUI paradigm at Xerox PARC?
Alan's kay Answer: Mr Rao has a good slant on this, in particular to give the overall credit to the larger research community -- that of ARPA-IPTO. Many of us at Parc were graduate students under ARPA-IPTO and we considered Parc "another ARPA project" (just supported by Xer


Interview's Question: Why isn't Alan Kay's FoNC (Fundamentals of New Computing) project more discussed or replicated?
Alan's kay Answer: I can't answer the question directly, but I can say a few words about the difficulties. The project came from long held feelings by many of us that there was much too much code for the actual meanings in many systems (by factors of hundreds and sometimes
