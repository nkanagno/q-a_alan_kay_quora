Computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra said that “It is far more likely that the programming occupation will become extinct than that programmers will ever approach professional status.” What did Dijkstra mean by that and do you agree with Dijkstra?,"I’ll start by saying that I don’t clearly understand the English as simply stated.

However, three things might help us (a) English was not Edsger’s native language (b) he was very proud of his skills in English (c) he delighted in coming up with snide remarks (one of his good friends was Bob Barton, who also liked to do this).

I read this as “programmers will never approach professional status” — and — “the programming occupation will never become extinct (too bad)”!

He desired the process of getting computers to “do what we mean!” to be rather like the mathematics he was used to when getting his PhD in mathematical physics. In his own words:

After having programmed for some three years, I had a discussion with A. van Wijngaarden, who was then my boss at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam, a discussion for which I shall remain grateful to him as long as I live. The point was that I was supposed to study theoretical physics at the University of Leiden simultaneously, and as I found the two activities harder and harder to combine, I had to make up my mind, either to stop programming and become a real, respectable theoretical physicist, or to carry my study of physics to a formal completion only, with a minimum of effort, and to become....., yes what? A programmer? But was that a respectable profession? For after all, what was programming? Where was the sound body of knowledge that could support it as an intellectually respectable discipline? I remember quite vividly how I envied my hardware colleagues, who, when asked about their professional competence, could at least point out that they knew everything about vacuum tubes, amplifiers and the rest, whereas I felt that, when faced with that question, I would stand empty-handed.

He had “bitten the apple” and gotten hooked. And the dual attractions and repulsions of math on the one side and programming on the other stayed with him his whole life.

It was his pristineness towards the former that got him to disparage the latter — even though that was the path he also had taken …"
Was one byte ever less than eight bits in the past?,"When I started “programming as a job” in the US Air Force (ca 1962), the most general meaning for a “byte” was “a contiguous field of bits in a word that was smaller in size than the word”.

I still remember feeling annoyed when IBM redefined the term to mean an 8-bit entity (I remember this from 1964 when System 360 was announced — however, IBM could have forced the redefinition before this).

The Wikipedia article is rather wishy-washy about this. I think that my definition in the first paragraph is actually correct. "
"Is programming learned inductively or deductively?", "I don’t feel I completely understand this question (or perhaps don't understand the intention behind the question). But we can certainly start by comparing various kinds of reasoning already addressed in Quora: What's the difference between “inductive“ “deductive“ and “abductive“ reasoning? Let me add an additional one or two: “projective reasoning” — this is similar to “abductive reasoning”. It is familiar in both mathematics and programming as a kind of “feeling” about a situation (in programming it often occurs as a “sense of difficulty or ease” when a problem is mentioned). It is also likely related to what is called “forward reasoning”: to take definitions/premises and drive them “forward” using logical operations to reach conclusions (so: similar to deduction but driving “outwards”). My first paying job as a programmer/coder was in 1962 — so 63 years ago as of this writing — as an enlisted man in the US Air Force. They had a test to screen for possible aptitudes. Those who passed were trained by IBM in a single dense wall to wall week and then sent back to base to write and debug code (i.e. the rest of the training was “on the job training”). From my own personal experience I would say the answer to this question is “All of the above (including my additions) and more”. One example of “more” is that it was common enough back then for the hardware to have glitches — sometimes “intermittant glitches” — so that one could not completely rely that executions were completely deterministic. I think I might instead say that “Learning programming is both learning how to “solve problems” and especially how to “find problems” mixed in with much more “design” than one appreciates at first.”"

"What are your thoughts on a future where code is represented as a structured model, rather than text? Do you think that AI-powered coding assistants benefit from that?","First, it’s worth noting that the “syntax recognition” phase of most compilers already does build a “structured model”, often in what used to be called a “canonical form” (an example of this might be a “pseudo-function tree” where every elementary process"

"How do computers deal with images, written texts, videos, etc.? Does it transform them into 0 and 1 codes?","Yes. A good way to think of this is that a binary digit — a bit — is not really a “0” or a “1” but just “off” or “on” (or “not there” or “there”). In other words, it is like a simple mark on a wall or paper. So a bit is more intuitively represented by sym"

"Why were computers like the DEC PDP-10 called minicomputers, since they weren't really that small?","The PDP-10 was a “mainframe computer” and was not called a minicomputer. The PDP-8 was called a minicomputer, as were most of the early PDP-11s.

One angle on the name, which to some extent correlated with physical size was the “word size” of the machine."

How do you know when you have the chops to build your own tools?,"I don’t know a good general answer.

Why did Xerox fail to successfully exploit any of its ideas at its Palo Alto Research Center from the 1960s and 1970s?,"A common myth (and easily exposed with a little poking of the web). The simplest one is “the 60s” (Xerox Parc started in 1970).
